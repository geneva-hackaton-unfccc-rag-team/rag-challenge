			Being guided by the best available scientific knowledge, including, inter alia, the assessment reports / the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and inputs and resources from Parties,
			Recognizing that deep cuts in global greenhouse gas emissions will be required to achieve the ultimate objective of the Convention and the long-term temperature limit / holding the increase in global average temperature, and that such cuts must be achieved within a time frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure that food production is not threatened and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner,
			Also recognizing that scenarios consistent with a likely chance of holding the global average temperature increase to below 2 °C relative to pre-industrial levels include substantial cuts in anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by mid-century and net emission levels near zero gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent or below in 2100,
			Further recognizing that economy-wide emission reduction budgets provide the highest level of clarity, predictability and environmental integrity,
			Acknowledging that carbon pricing is a key approach for cost-effectiveness of the cuts in global greenhouse gas emissions,
			Option (a): Emphasizing that adaptation is a global challenge and a common responsibility that requires global solidarity that must be addressed with the same urgency as, and in political / legal parity with, mitigation,

			Reaffirming that responses to climate change should be coordinated with social and economic development in an integrated manner with a view to avoiding adverse impacts on the latter, taking into full account the legitimate priority needs of developing countries and their right to equitable access to sustainable development and for achieving economic growth and the eradication of poverty,
			Also reaffirming that all developing countries need access to the resources required to achieve sustainable social and economic development and that, in order for developing countries to progress towards that goal, their energy consumption will need to grow, taking into account the opportunities for achieving greater energy efficiency and for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, including through the application of new technologies on terms which make such an application economically and socially beneficial,
			Recognizing that action / cooperative action by and among subnational authorities, intergovernmental organizations, civil society, indigenous peoples, local communities, the private sector, financial institutions and Parties can catalyse and significantly enhance the impact of policy implementation by Parties in reducing emissions, reducing vulnerability and building resilience to the adverse effects of climate change,
