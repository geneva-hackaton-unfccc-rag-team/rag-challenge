		Glasgow work programme on Action for Climate Empowerment
			
			I.	Guiding principles
				1.	The Glasgow work programme on Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE) sets out the scope of and provides the basis for activities related to implementing ACE in accordance with the provisions of the Convention and the Paris Agreement. The work programme serves as a flexible framework for country-driven action that addresses the specific needs and circumstances of Parties and reflects their national priorities and initiatives while building long-term capacity and expertise in developed and developing countries for implementing ACE, including by promoting strong domestic enabling environments.
				2.	The Glasgow work programme builds on work undertaken in response to relevant decisions of the Conference of the Parties (COP) and the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement (CMA).1
				3.	The Glasgow work programme shall be guided by:
					(a)	A country-driven approach;
					(b)	Cost-effectiveness;
					(c)	Flexibility;
					(d)	A gender and intergenerational approach;
					(e)	A phased approach that integrates activities under Article 6 of the Convention and Article 12 of the Paris Agreement into climate change programmes and strategies;
					(f)	The promotion of partnerships, networks and synergies, in particular synergies among conventions;
					(g)	An interdisciplinary multisectoral, multi-stakeholder and participatory approach;
					(h)	A holistic systematic approach;
					(i)	The principles of sustainable development.
				
			II.	Scope
				4.	The Glasgow work programme comprises activities under four action-oriented priority areas and the six ACE elements that Parties, taking into account national circumstances, and non-Party stakeholders may carry out to enhance implementation of ACE, including through cooperation, collaboration and partnerships.
				
			III.	Priority areas
				5.	Four thematic priority areas have been identified as relevant to addressing gaps and challenges in implementing the six ACE elements and for creating opportunities to accelerate that implementation.
				
				
				
				
				
				1 Decisions 15/CP.18, 19/CP.20, 17/CP.22, 15/CP.25 and 17/CMA.1.
				
					
				A.	Policy coherence
					
						6.	Recognizing that activities related to ACE are also carried out under workstreams that are part of the UNFCCC process, as well as under frameworks and processes of the United Nations system and in multiple sectors and strategies at the national level, the priority area of policy coherence has the aim of strengthening coordination of work under ACE. Efficient and effective ACE implementation can be enabled by undertaking the following at the international level:
							(a)	Inviting all constituted bodies under the Convention and the Paris Agreement to include in their regular reports information on how ACE is implemented under their respective workstreams;
							(b)	Inviting the Presidencies of the COP and the CMA, with the support of the secretariat, to convene an in-session event at each of their sessions focused on a thematic area relevant to the Convention and the Paris Agreement to promote coherence and strengthen coordination of work on ACE undertaken by constituted bodies and other United Nations entities and under other United Nations processes;
							(c)	Encouraging the secretariat and other United Nations and intergovernmental organizations to strengthen their collaboration with a view to ensuring the provision of coordinated support to Parties for their activities related to ACE and avoiding duplication of work.
						7.	At the national level, Parties are encouraged to strengthen integration of ACE into the development and implementation of national climate policies, plans, strategies and action, including by developing and implementing a national strategy that covers all six ACE elements and facilitates broad cross-sectoral coordination and collaboration.
						8.	In addition, at the national level, Parties are also encouraged to continue designating, assigning responsibilities to, and providing support, including technical and financial support, and access to information and materials to national ACE focal points. Such responsibilities could include identifying areas for possible international cooperation and opportunities for strengthening synergies with action under other conventions, and coordinating the preparation of the chapter on ACE in national communications, ensuring that relevant contact information, including weblinks, is provided therein.

	Annex I
		
		Recommendations forwarded by the forum pertaining to activity 1 of the workplan: exploring approaches to inform the development and implementation of climate change mitigation strategies, plans, policies and programmes that maximize the positive and minimize the negative impacts of response measures
			1.	Encourage Parties to engage relevant stakeholders at each step of the process of designing and implementing climate mitigation policies and policies to achieve sustainable development, including through social dialogue, when possible and subject to national circumstances. The relevant stakeholders among others include workers, employers, organizations, academia, the public and private sectors, women and civil society.
			2.	Encourage Parties to explore complementary policies, such as economic policies, social protection and labour policies, to help strengthen the outcomes of the implementation of mitigation strategies, plans, policies and programmes, including nationally determined contributions and low-emission development strategies.
			3.	Encourage Parties to strengthen international and regional cooperation as it contributes to planning and implementation of mitigation policies with environmental and socioeconomic benefits, for example to help facilitate technology development and transfer in accordance with Article 10 of the Paris Agreement, and strive towards harmonized regional approaches.
			4.	Encourage Parties to use existing qualitative and quantitative assessment methodologies and tools to understand social, economic and employment effects of proposed mitigation measures as a way to inform and guide climate policies and to maximize the positive and minimize the negative effects of the implementation of response measures. More analysis of impacts, including, inter alia, sectoral, national, subnational, domestic and cross border, would be useful for informing climate policies and understanding how to maximize the positive and minimize the negative effects of the implementation of response measures.
			5.	Encourage the forum and its Katowice Committee of Experts on the Impacts of the Implementation of Response Measures to enhance the capacity of Parties, particularly developing country Parties, through training and capacity-building efforts, including existing initiatives. This will enable Parties to carry out their own assessments and analyses of the impacts of response measures.
