		Informal note by the Presidencies of COP 22 and COP 23
			17 November 2017
Talanoa dialogue
	Approach
		The Presidencies of COP 22 and COP 23 conducted extensive consultations on the Talanoa dialogue throughout 2017, which continued during the twenty-third session of the COP. This informal note has been prepared by the Presidencies of COP 22 and COP 23 on this basis.
		Mandate
			The COP by its decision 1/CP.21, paragraph 20, decided to “convene a facilitative dialogue among Parties in 2018 to take stock of the collective efforts of Parties in relation to progress towards the long-term goal referred to in Article 4, paragraph 1, of the Agreement and to inform the preparation of nationally determined contributions pursuant to Article 4, paragraph 8, of the Agreement”.
		Features of the Talanoa dialogue
			Based on input received by Parties, the main features of the dialogue are as follows:
				−	The dialogue should be constructive, facilitative and solutions oriented;
				−	The dialogue should not lead to discussions of a confrontational nature in which individual Parties or groups of Parties are singled out;
					−	The dialogue will be conducted in the spirit of the Pacific tradition of Talanoa:
						o	Talanoa is a traditional approach used in Fiji and the Pacific to engage in an inclusive, participatory and transparent dialogue;
						o	The purpose of Talanoa is to share stories, build empathy and trust;
						o	During the process, participants advance their knowledge through common understanding;
						o	It creates a platform of dialogue, which results in better decision-making for the collective good;
						o	By focusing on the benefits of collective action, this process will inform decision-making and move the global climate agenda forward;
					−	The dialogue should be conducted in a manner that promotes cooperation;
					−	The dialogue will be structured around three general topics:
						o	Where are we?
						o	Where do we want to go?
						o	How do we get there?
				−	The dialogue will be conducted in a manner that promotes enhanced ambition. The dialogue will consider, as one of its elements, the efforts of Parties on action and support, as appropriate, in the pre-2020 period;
				−	The dialogue will fulfil its mandate, in a comprehensive and non-restrictive manner;
				−	The dialogue will consist of a preparatory and a political phase;
				−	The Presidencies of COP 23 and COP 24 will jointly lead both phases of the dialogue and co-chair the political phase at COP 24;
				−	A dedicated space will be provided in the dialogue, both during the preparatory and the political phase to facilitate the understanding of the implications of the Special Report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change on Global Warming of 1.5°C;
					−	As regards inputs to the dialogue:
						o	The Special Report by the IPCC on global warming of 1.5°C requested by the COP will inform the dialogue;
						o	Parties, stakeholders and expert institutions are encouraged to prepare analytical and policy relevant inputs to inform the dialogue and submit these and other proposed inputs, including those from intergovernmental organisations and UNFCCC bodies, by 2 April 2018 for discussions in conjunction with the May session, and by 29 October 2018 for discussions in conjunction with COP 24;
						o	The Presidencies of COP 23 and COP 24 will also provide inputs to inform the dialogue;
						o	An online platform will facilitate access to all inputs to the dialogue, which will be overseen by the Presidencies of COP 23 and COP 24;
						o	The secretariat will be requested to prepare relevant inputs and to develop and manage the online platform under the guidance of the Presidencies of COP 23 and COP 24;
				−	The preparatory phase will seek to build a strong evidence-based foundation for the political phase:
					o	The preparatory phase will start after the dialogue is launched at COP 23, in January 2018, and will end at COP 24;
					o	Parties and non-Party stakeholders are invited to cooperate in convening local, national, regional or global events in support of the dialogue and to prepare and make available relevant inputs;
					o	The May discussions will be used to explore the three central topics informed by inputs by various actors and institutions, including from the Technical Examination Process and Global Climate Action, with the support of the high-level champions;
					o	Summaries from all discussions will be prepared under the authority of the Presidencies of COP 23 and COP 24;
					o	The information and insights gained during the preparatory phase will be synthesised by the Presidencies of COP 23 and COP 24 to provide a foundation for the political phase;
						Figure 1 - Preparatory phase
			
				
				−	The political phase will bring high-level representatives of Parties together to take stock of the collective efforts of Parties in relation to progress towards the long-term goal referred to in Article 4, paragraph 1, of the Agreement and to inform the preparation of nationally determined contributions pursuant to Article 4, paragraph 8, of the Agreement:
					o	The political phase will take place at COP 24 with the participation of Ministers;
					o	This phase will build on the preparatory phase and focus on the objectives of the dialogue;
					o	Political discussions will include roundtables to ensure focussed and interactive discussions among Ministers;
					o	At the closing meeting of the dialogue, the Presidencies of COP 23 and COP 24 will provide a summary of key messages from the roundtables;
				Figure 2 - Political phase
			
				
				−	It will be important to send clear forward looking signals to ensure that the outcome of the dialogue is greater confidence, courage and enhanced ambition;
				−	The outcome of the dialogue is expected to capture the political momentum, and help Parties to inform the preparation of nationally determined contributions;
				−	The outputs of the dialogue will include reports and summaries of the discussions.

		Annex
		Gender action plan
			1.	By decision 21/CP.22, paragraph 27, the Subsidiary Body for Implementation was requested to develop a gender action plan (GAP) in order to support the implementation of gender-related decisions and mandates in the UNFCCC process, which may include priority areas, key activities and indicators, timelines for implementation, responsible and key actors and indicative resource requirements for each activity, and to further elaborate its review and monitoring processes.
			2.	The GAP, created under the Lima work programme on gender, seeks to advance women’s full, equal and meaningful participation and promote gender-responsive climate policy and the mainstreaming of a gender perspective in the implementation of the Convention and the work of Parties, the secretariat, United Nations entities and all stakeholders at all levels.
			3.	Gender-responsive climate policy requires further strengthening in all activities concerning adaptation, mitigation and related means of implementation (finance, technology development and transfer, and capacity-building) as well as decision-making on the implementation of climate policies. The GAP recognizes the need for women to be represented in all aspects of the UNFCCC process and the need for gender mainstreaming through all relevant targets and goals in activities under the Convention as an important contribution to increasing their effectiveness.
			4.	The GAP recognizes that gender-related action is being progressed across all areas of the Convention and with respect to the Paris Agreement. Many of the activities in the GAP have been the subject of action by a variety of relevant organizations and will continue to require further action beyond the time frame of the plan.
			5.	The activities in the GAP vary in terms of measurability, and Parties are at various stages in terms of progress on this agenda. Some actions may be afforded differing degrees of prioritization according to the nature and scale of the climate policies being implemented and the capacities of Parties. The GAP recognizes that climate action under the Convention is a Party-driven process.
			Priority areas
				6.	Parties, the secretariat and relevant organizations are invited to undertake the activities contained in the GAP, as appropriate. The GAP sets out, in five priority areas, the activities that will drive the achievement of its objectives.
				A.	Capacity-building, knowledge-sharing and communication
					7.	The GAP seeks to enhance the understanding and expertise of stakeholders on the systematic integration of gender considerations and the application of such understanding and expertise in the thematic areas under the Convention and the Paris Agreement and in policies, programmes and projects on the ground.
				B.	Gender balance, participation and women’s leadership
					8.	The GAP seeks to achieve and sustain the full, equal and meaningful participation of women in the UNFCCC process.
				C.	Coherence
					9.	The GAP seeks to strengthen the integration of gender considerations within the work of UNFCCC bodies, the secretariat and other United Nation entities and stakeholders towards the consistent implementation of gender-related mandates and activities.
				D.	Gender-responsive implementation and means of implementation
					10.	The GAP aims to ensure the respect, promotion and consideration of gender equality and the empowerment of women in the implementation of the Convention and the Paris Agreement.
				E.	Monitoring and reporting
					11.	The GAP seeks to improve tracking in relation to the implementation of and reporting on gender-related mandates under the UNFCCC.
