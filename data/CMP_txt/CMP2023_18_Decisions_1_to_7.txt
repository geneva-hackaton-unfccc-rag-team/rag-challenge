			5.	Requests the UNFCCC national focal points of Parties to the Kyoto Protocol with non‑responsive designated national authorities to confirm to the secretariat whether the Party concerned still wishes to participate in the clean development mechanism and whether the UNFCCC national focal points will continue to perform the tasks of the designated national authority or designate another authority to carry out those tasks;
			6.	Also requests the Executive Board to address the issue of non-responsive designated national authorities as described in paragraphs ‎‎4–‎‎5 above;

			8.	Also acknowledges that the Executive Board ceased receiving requests under the temporary measures referred to in paragraph ‎‎7 above on 30 June 2023, when the process for the submission of requests for transition of clean development mechanism activities to the mechanism established by Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement became operational;
