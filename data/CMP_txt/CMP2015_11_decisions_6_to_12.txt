Decision 8/CMP.11
Methodology for the collection of international transaction log fees in the biennium 2016–2017
	The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol,
		Recalling Article 13, paragraph 5, of the Kyoto Protocol,
		Also recalling decisions 11/CMP.3, 10/CMP.5, 9/CMP.6 and 8/CMP.8,
		Recognizing the importance of sufficient and stable funding for the international transaction log,
		1.	Adopts the scale of fees for the international transaction log for the biennium 2016–2017 contained in the annex;
		2.	Decides that fees for the international transaction log paid by a Party for the biennium 2016–2017 shall be calculated by multiplying the scale of fees for that Party, as contained in the annex, by the budget for the international transaction log for the biennium 2016–2017, with the fees for the first year of the biennium being equal to the fees for the second year of the biennium;
		3.	Requests the Executive Secretary to notify Parties connected to the international transaction log in the biennium 2016–2017 of the annual fees, calculated in accordance with paragraph 2 above, as early as possible and at least four months in advance of the relevant calendar year, where possible;
		4.	Decides that, if a Party connects to the international transaction log for the first time or reconnects to it following disconnection during the biennium 2016–2017, the scale of fees for that Party shall be that contained in the annex, or, for Parties not listed in the table contained in the annex, shall be made equal to 130 per cent of their Kyoto Protocol adjusted scale for the relevant biennium;
		5.	Also decides that fees paid by a Party that connects to the international transaction log for the first time shall be deducted from the resource requirement for activities relating to the international transaction log in the next biennium;
		6.	Further decides that fees paid by a Party that connects to the international transaction log for the first time or, following disconnection, reconnects to it during the biennium 2016–2017, shall be proportioned for the period between the date of connection or reconnection of its registry and the end of the biennium, except for the period for which the fees were already paid;
		7.	Decides that, where a Party disconnects during the biennium 2016–2017, the Party shall cover the fees for the full year in which the disconnection took place, and that, if the disconnection takes place in the first year of the biennium and the Party does not reconnect in the second year of the biennium, fees for the second year of the biennium shall not apply;
		8.	Authorizes the international transaction log administrator to disconnect the registry of a Party from the international transaction log in the event of the non-payment of its fees by that Party, provided that such disconnection shall not be effected earlier than four months after the beginning of the relevant calendar year, at least two reminders have already been given to the Party and consultations have taken place with the Party concerned prior to the final reminder;
		9.	Also authorizes the Executive Secretary to draw up funds from unspent balances (carry-over) of the Trust Fund for the International Transaction Log from previous financial periods to cover the potential shortfall in fees due to the disconnection of Parties during the biennium 2016–2017;
		10.	Requests the international transaction log administrator to provide, in its annual reports for 2016 and 2017, information on transactions of Kyoto Protocol units;
	11.	Also requests the international transaction log administrator to publish, in its annual reports, a table listing the scale and the level of fees and the status of payments for all Parties connected to the international transaction log.
