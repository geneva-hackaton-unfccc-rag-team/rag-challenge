		3.	Strongly urges Parties that have not made contributions in full to the core budget for the current and/or previous bienniums to do so without further delay and expresses concern regarding the high level of outstanding contributions to the core budget for the current and previous bienniums, which has resulted in difficulties with both cash flow and the effective implementation of activities;
		4.

		10.	Also requests the secretariat to increase transparency regarding the reappropriation of portions of the core budget and of funding in the trust fund for supplementary activities;
		11.	Further requests the secretariat to significantly improve the transparency of its budget management process, including by preparing quarterly reports on the extent to which the core and supplementary budgets are funded, starting in the first quarter of 2025 at the latest, and updating documents FCCC/SBI/2019/INF.4, FCCC/SBI/2019/INF.12 and FCCC/SBI/2020/INF.3 for consideration by the Subsidiary Body for Implementation at its sixty-second session (June 2025);
