		Training programme for technical experts participating in the technical expert review of biennial transparency reports
			A.	General
				1.	The aim of the courses forming part of the training programme is to train technical experts participating in the technical expert review under the enhanced transparency framework under the Paris Agreement.
					2.	The courses incorporate the corresponding provisions in the MPGs relating to flexibility.
			B.	Availability
				3.	The training programme will be available to experts included on the UNFCCC roster of experts.
				4.	All courses will be available online all year round, with an option to download them.
			C.	Examinations
				5.	All courses will have an examination.
				6.	Examination procedures will be standardized, objective and transparent.
				7.	Examinations will be offered either online or in person. When participants attend an in-person training seminar, the examination may take place during that seminar. Other arrangements for examinations may also be made, provided that the examinations take place under the supervision of the secretariat.
				8.	Experts who have already participated in training programmes and related technical reviews under the measurement, reporting and verification arrangements under the Convention do not need to take examinations for courses under the training programme for technical experts participating in the technical expert review of BTRs that cover the same information as courses taken previously, taking into account their knowledge and experience.
			D.	Instructed courses
				9.	Once a year, online training courses facilitated by instructor(s) will be available. In-person training seminars will also be available. Additional regional training seminars targeted at technical experts from developing country Parties, particularly the least developed countries and small island developing States, may be organized.
			E.	Courses of the training programme
				10.	The following courses relating to information specified in paragraph 150 of the MPGs will be developed:
					(a)	General and cross-cutting aspects for the technical expert review under the enhanced transparency framework under the Paris Agreement (this course should take into account, inter alia, para. 149 of the MPGs);
					(b)	Technical review of national inventory reports of anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases, reported in accordance with chapter II of the annex to decision 18/CMA.1:
						(i)	General guidance and cross-cutting issues;
						(ii)	Courses pertaining to the greenhouse gas inventory sectors referred to in the MPGs:
						a.	Energy;
						b.	Industrial processes and product use;
						c.	Agriculture;
						d.	Land use, land-use change and forestry;
						e.	Waste;
					(c)	Technical review of the information necessary to track progress made in implementing and achieving nationally determined contributions under Article 4 of the Paris Agreement reported in accordance with chapter III of the annex to decision 18/CMA.1 (including the information necessary to track progress on the implementation and achievement of the domestic policies and measures implemented to address the social and economic consequences of response measures for nationally determined contributions that consist of adaptation actions and/or economic diversification plans resulting in mitigation co-benefits, and also including information in relation to a Party’s participation in cooperative approaches, as applicable);
					(d)	Technical review of the information on financial, technology development and transfer and capacity-building support provided to developing country Parties under Articles 9–11 of the Paris Agreement reported in accordance with chapter V of the annex to decision 18/CMA.1.
