Decision 1/CMA.5
Outcome of the first global stocktake
	The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement,
	Recalling Article 2, paragraph 1, of the Paris Agreement, which provides that the Agreement, in enhancing the implementation of the Convention, including its objective, aims to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty,
	Also recalling Article 2, paragraph 2, of the Paris Agreement, which provides that the Agreement will be implemented to reflect equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances,
	Further recalling, as provided in Article 14, paragraph 1, of the Paris Agreement, that the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement shall periodically take stock of the implementation of the Paris Agreement to assess the collective progress towards achieving the purpose of the Agreement and its long-term goals, and that it shall do so in a comprehensive and facilitative manner, considering mitigation, adaptation and the means of implementation and support, and in the light of equity and the best available science,
	Recalling, as provided in Article 14, paragraph 3, of the Paris Agreement, that the outcome of the global stocktake shall inform Parties in updating and enhancing, in a nationally determined manner, their actions and support in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Agreement, as well as in enhancing international cooperation for climate action,
	Also recalling decisions 19/CMA.1, 1/CMA.2, 1/CMA.3 and 1/CMA.4,
	Underlining the critical role of multilateralism based on United Nations values and principles, including in the context of the implementation of the Convention and the Paris Agreement, and the importance of international cooperation for addressing global issues, including climate change, in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty,
	Acknowledging that climate change is a common concern of humankind and that Parties should, when taking action to address climate change, respect, promote and consider their respective obligations on human rights, the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment, the right to health, the rights of Indigenous Peoples, local communities, migrants, children, persons with disabilities and people in vulnerable situations and the right to development, as well as gender equality, empowerment of women and intergenerational equity,
	Recognizing the fundamental priority of safeguarding food security and ending hunger, and the particular vulnerabilities of food production systems to the adverse impacts of climate change,
	Also recognizing the critical role of protecting, conserving and restoring water systems and water-related ecosystems in delivering climate adaptation benefits and co‑benefits, while ensuring social and environmental safeguards,
	Noting the importance of ensuring the integrity of all ecosystems, including in forests, the ocean, mountains and the cryosphere, and the protection of biodiversity, recognized by some cultures as Mother Earth, and also noting the importance of “climate justice”, when taking action to address climate change,
	Underlining the urgent need to address, in a comprehensive and synergetic manner, the interlinked global crises of climate change and biodiversity loss in the broader context of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, as well as the vital importance of protecting, conserving, restoring and sustainably using nature and ecosystems for effective and sustainable climate action,
	I.	Context and cross-cutting considerations
		1.	Welcomes that the Paris Agreement has driven near-universal climate action by setting goals and sending signals to the world regarding the urgency of responding to the climate crisis;
		2.	Underlines that, despite overall progress on mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation and support, Parties are not yet collectively on track towards achieving the purpose of the Paris Agreement and its long-term goals;
		3.	Reaffirms the Paris Agreement temperature goal of holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change;
		4.	Underscores that the impacts of climate change will be much lower at the temperature increase of 1.5 °C compared with 2 °C and resolves to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C;
		5.	Expresses serious concern that 2023 is set to be the warmest year on record and that impacts from climate change are rapidly accelerating and emphasizes the need for urgent action and support to keep the 1.5 °C goal within reach and to address the climate crisis in this critical decade;
		6.	Commits to accelerate action in this critical decade on the basis of the best available science, reflecting equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities in the light of different national circumstances and in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty;
		7.	Underscores Article 2, paragraph 2, of the Paris Agreement, which stipulates that the Agreement will be implemented to reflect equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances;
		8.	Emphasizes that finance, capacity-building and technology transfer are critical enablers of climate action;
		9.	Reaffirms that sustainable and just solutions to the climate crisis must be founded on meaningful and effective social dialogue and participation of all stakeholders, including Indigenous Peoples, local communities and governments, women, and youth and children, and notes that the global transition to low emissions and climate-resilient development provides opportunities and challenges for sustainable development and poverty eradication;
		10.	Underlines that just transitions can support more robust and equitable mitigation outcomes, with tailored approaches addressing different contexts;
		11.	Recognizes the specific needs and special circumstances of developing country Parties, especially those that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, as provided for in the Convention and the Paris Agreement;
		12.	Welcomes the conclusion of the first global stocktake and expresses appreciation and gratitude to those involved in the technical dialogue thereunder and to the co-facilitators for preparing the synthesis report and other outputs of the technical assessment component;
		13.	Welcomes the high-level events convened under the first global stocktake and takes note of the summary thereof;
		14.	Welcomes the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and expresses appreciation and gratitude to those involved in preparing the reports in the sixth assessment cycle for their excellent work and dedication to continuing their work during the extraordinary circumstances of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic;
		15.	Notes with alarm and serious concern the following findings of the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change:
			(a)	That human activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally caused global warming of about 1.1 °C;
			(b)	That human-caused climate change impacts are already being felt in every region across the globe, with those who have contributed the least to climate change being most vulnerable to the impacts, and, together with losses and damages, will increase with every increment of warming;
			(c)	That most observed adaptation responses are fragmented, incremental, sector-specific and unequally distributed across regions, and that, despite the progress made, significant adaptation gaps still exist across sectors and regions and will continue to grow under current levels of implementation;
		16.	Notes the following findings of the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change:
			(a)	That mitigation efforts embedded within the wider development context can increase the pace, depth and breadth of emissions reductions, as well as that policies that shift development pathways towards sustainability can broaden the portfolio of available mitigation responses and enable the pursuit of synergies with development objectives;
			(b)	That both adaptation and mitigation financing would need to increase manyfold, and that there is sufficient global capital to close the global investment gap but there are barriers to redirecting capital to climate action, and that Governments through public funding and clear signals to investors are key in reducing these barriers, and investors, central banks and financial regulators can also play their part;
			(c)	That feasible, effective and low-cost mitigation options are already available in all sectors to keep 1.5 °C within reach in this critical decade with the necessary cooperation on technologies and support;
		17.	Notes with concern the pre-2020 gaps in both mitigation ambition and implementation by developed country Parties and that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change had earlier indicated that developed countries must reduce emissions by 25–40 per cent below 1990 levels by 2020, which was not achieved;
	II.	Collective progress towards achieving the purpose and long-term goals of the Paris Agreement, including under Article 2, paragraph 1(a–c), in the light of equity and the best available science, and informing Parties in updating and enhancing, in a nationally determined manner, action and support
		A.	Mitigation
			18.	Acknowledges that significant collective progress towards the Paris Agreement temperature goal has been made, from an expected global temperature increase of 4 °C according to some projections prior to the adoption of the Agreement to an increase in the range of 2.1–2.8 °C with the full implementation of the latest nationally determined contributions;
			19.	Expresses appreciation that all Parties have communicated nationally determined contributions that demonstrate progress towards achieving the Paris Agreement temperature goal, most of which provided the information necessary to facilitate their clarity, transparency and understanding;
				20.	Commends the 68 Parties that have communicated long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies and notes that 87 per cent of the global economy in terms of share of gross domestic product is covered by targets for climate neutrality, carbon neutrality, greenhouse gas neutrality or net zero emissions, which provides the possibility of achieving a temperature increase below 2 °C when taking into account the full implementation of those strategies;
				21.	Notes with concern the findings in the latest version of the synthesis report on nationally determined contributions that implementation of current nationally determined contributions would reduce emissions on average by 2 per cent compared with the 2019 level by 2030 and that significantly greater emission reductions are required to align with global greenhouse gas emission trajectories in line with the Paris Agreement temperature goal and recognizes the urgent need to address this gap;
				22.	Notes the findings in the synthesis report on nationally determined contributions that greenhouse gas emission levels in 2030 are projected to be 5.3 per cent lower than in 2019 if all nationally determined contributions, including all conditional elements, are fully implemented and that enhanced financial resources, technology transfer and technical cooperation, and capacity-building support are needed to achieve this;
				23.	Notes with concern the findings of the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that policies implemented by the end of 2020 are projected to result in higher global greenhouse gas emissions than those implied by the nationally determined contributions, indicating an implementation gap, and resolves to take action to urgently address this gap;
			24.	Notes with significant concern that, despite progress, global greenhouse gas emissions trajectories are not yet in line with the Paris Agreement temperature goal, and that there is a rapidly narrowing window for raising ambition and implementing existing commitments in order to achieve it;
			25.	Expresses concern that the carbon budget consistent with achieving the Paris Agreement temperature goal is now small and being rapidly depleted and acknowledges that historical cumulative net carbon dioxide emissions already account for about four fifths of the total carbon budget for a 50 per cent probability of limiting global warming to 1.5 °C;
			26.	Recognizes the finding in the Synthesis Report of the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, based on global modelled pathways and assumptions, that global greenhouse gas emissions are projected to peak between 2020 and at the latest before 2025 in global modelled pathways that limit warming to 1.5 °C with no or limited overshoot and in those that limit warming to 2 °C and assume immediate action, notes that this does not imply peaking in all countries within this time frame, and that time frames for peaking may be shaped by sustainable development, poverty eradication needs and equity and be in line with different national circumstances and recognizes that technology development and transfer on voluntary and mutually agreed terms, as well as capacity-building and financing, can support countries in this regard;
			27.	Also recognizes that limiting global warming to 1.5 °C with no or limited overshoot requires deep, rapid and sustained reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions of 43 per cent by 2030 and 60 per cent by 2035 relative to the 2019 level and reaching net zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050;
				28.	Further recognizes the need for deep, rapid and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in line with 1.5 °C pathways and calls on Parties to contribute to the following global efforts, in a nationally determined manner, taking into account the Paris Agreement and their different national circumstances, pathways and approaches:
					(a)	Tripling renewable energy capacity globally and doubling the global average annual rate of energy efficiency improvements by 2030;
					(b)	Accelerating efforts towards the phase-down of unabated coal power;
					(c)	Accelerating efforts globally towards net zero emission energy systems, utilizing zero- and low-carbon fuels, well before or by around mid-century;
					(d)	Transitioning away from fossil fuels in energy systems, in a just, orderly and equitable manner, accelerating action in this critical decade, so as to achieve net zero by 2050 in keeping with the science;
					(e)	Accelerating zero- and low-emission technologies, including, inter alia, renewables, nuclear, abatement and removal technologies such as carbon capture and utilization and storage, particularly in hard-to-abate sectors, and low-carbon hydrogen production;
					(f)	Accelerating the substantial reduction of non-carbon-dioxide emissions globally, in particular methane emissions by 2030;
					(g)	Accelerating the reduction of emissions from road transport on a range of pathways, including through development of infrastructure and rapid deployment of zero‑ and low‑emission vehicles;
					(h)	Phasing out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that do not address energy poverty or just transitions, as soon as possible;
			29.	Recognizes that transitional fuels can play a role in facilitating the energy transition while ensuring energy security;
			30.	Welcomes that over the past decade mitigation technologies have become increasingly available, and that the unit costs of several low-emission technologies have fallen continuously, notably wind power and solar power and storage, thanks to technological advancements, economies of scale, increased efficiency and streamlined manufacturing processes, while recognizing the need to increase the affordability and accessibility of such technologies;
				31.	Emphasizes the urgent need for accelerated implementation of domestic mitigation measures in accordance with Article 4, paragraph 2, of the Paris Agreement, as well as the use of voluntary cooperation referred to in Article 6, paragraph 1, of the Paris Agreement;
			32.	Also emphasizes the urgent need to strengthen integrated, holistic and balanced non-market approaches in accordance with Article 6, paragraph 8, of the Paris Agreement, in the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication, in a coordinated and effective manner, including through mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology transfer and capacity-building, as appropriate;
			33.	Further emphasizes the importance of conserving, protecting and restoring nature and ecosystems towards achieving the Paris Agreement temperature goal, including through enhanced efforts towards halting and reversing deforestation and forest degradation by 2030, and other terrestrial and marine ecosystems acting as sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases and by conserving biodiversity, while ensuring social and environmental safeguards, in line with the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework;
			34.	Notes the need for enhanced support and investment, including through financial resources, technology transfer and capacity-building, for efforts towards halting and reversing deforestation and forest degradation by 2030 in the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication, in accordance with Article 5 of the Paris Agreement, including through results-based payments for policy approaches and positive incentives for activities relating to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries; and alternative policy approaches, such as joint mitigation and adaptation approaches for the integral and sustainable management of forests, while reaffirming the importance of incentivizing, as appropriate, non-carbon benefits associated with such approaches;
				35.	Invites Parties to preserve and restore the ocean and coastal ecosystems and scale up, as appropriate, ocean-based mitigation action;
				36.	Notes the importance of transitioning to sustainable lifestyles and sustainable patterns of consumption and production in efforts to address climate change, including through circular economy approaches, and encourages efforts in this regard;
				37.	Recalls Article 3 and Article 4, paragraphs 3, 4, 5 and 11, of the Paris Agreement and requests Parties that have not yet done so to revisit and strengthen the 2030 targets in their nationally determined contributions as necessary to align with the Paris Agreement temperature goal by the end of 2024, taking into account different national circumstances;
				38.	Recalls Article 4, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement, which provides that developed country Parties should continue taking the lead by undertaking economy-wide absolute emission reduction targets, and that developing country Parties should continue enhancing their mitigation efforts and are encouraged to move over time towards economy-wide emission reduction or limitation targets in the light of different national circumstances;
				39.	Reaffirms the nationally determined nature of nationally determined contributions and Article 4, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement and encourages Parties to come forward in their next nationally determined contributions with ambitious, economy-wide emission reduction targets, covering all greenhouse gases, sectors and categories and aligned with limiting global warming to 1.5 °C, as informed by the latest science, in the light of different national circumstances;
				40.	Notes the importance of aligning nationally determined contributions with long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies and encourages Parties to align their next nationally determined contributions with long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies;
				41.	Notes the capacity challenges of the least developed countries and small island developing States related to preparing and communicating nationally determined contributions;
				42.	Urges Parties that have not yet done so and invites all other Parties to communicate or revise, by the sixth session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement (November 2024), their long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies referred to in Article 4, paragraph 19, of the Paris Agreement towards just transitions to net zero emissions by or around mid-century, taking into account different national circumstances;
		B.	Adaptation
			43.	Emphasizes the importance of the global goal on adaptation of enhancing adaptive capacity, strengthening resilience and reducing vulnerability to climate change with a view to contributing to sustainable development and ensuring an adequate adaptation response in the context of the temperature goal referred to in Article 2 of the Paris Agreement;
			44.	Recognizes the increasing adaptation planning and implementation efforts being undertaken by Parties towards enhancing adaptive capacity, strengthening resilience and reducing vulnerability, as set out in national adaptation plans, adaptation communications and nationally determined contributions, as appropriate, and welcomes that 51 Parties have submitted national adaptation plans and 62 Parties have submitted adaptation communications to date;
			45.	Recognizes the significant efforts of developing country Parties in formulating and implementing national adaptation plans, adaptation communications and nationally determined contributions, as appropriate, including through their domestic expenditure, as well as their increased efforts to align their national development plans;
			46.	Also recognizes the significant challenges developing country Parties face in accessing finance for implementing their national adaptation plans;
			47.	Notes with appreciation the contribution of relevant UNFCCC constituted bodies and institutional arrangements, including the Adaptation Committee, the Least Developed Countries Expert Group and the Nairobi work programme on impacts, vulnerability and adaptation to climate change, to the efforts referred to in paragraph ‎45 above;
			48.	Notes that there are gaps in implementation of, support for and collective assessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of adaptation, and that monitoring and evaluation of outcomes is critical for tracking the progress and improving the quality and awareness of adaptation action;
			49.	Acknowledges that establishing and improving national inventories of climate impacts over time and building accessible, user-driven climate services systems, including early warning systems, can strengthen the implementation of adaptation actions, and recognizes that one third of the world does not have access to early warning and climate information services, as well as the need to enhance coordination of activities by the systematic observation community;
			50.	Recalls the United Nations Secretary-General’s call made on World Meteorological Day on 23 March 2022 to protect everyone on Earth through universal coverage of early warning systems against extreme weather and climate change by 2027 and invites development partners, international financial institutions and the operating entities of the Financial Mechanism to provide support for implementation of the Early Warnings for All initiative;
			51.	Calls for urgent, incremental, transformational and country-driven adaptation action based on different national circumstances;
			52.	Recognizes that climate change impacts are often transboundary in nature and may involve complex, cascading risks that require knowledge-sharing and international cooperation for addressing them;
			53.	Emphasizes that the magnitude and rate of climate change and associated risks depend strongly on near-term mitigation and adaptation actions, that long-term planning for and accelerated implementation of adaptation, particularly in this decade, are critical to closing adaptation gaps and create many opportunities, and that accelerated financial support for developing countries from developed countries and other sources is a critical enabler;
			54.	Recognizes the importance of the iterative adaptation cycle for building adaptive capacity, strengthening resilience and reducing vulnerability and notes that the adaptation cycle is an iterative process, consisting of risk and impact assessment; planning; implementation; and monitoring, evaluation and learning, recognizing the importance of means of implementation and support for developing country Parties at each stage of the cycle;
			55.	Encourages the implementation of integrated, multi-sectoral solutions, such as land-use management, sustainable agriculture, resilient food systems, nature-based solutions and ecosystem-based approaches, and protecting, conserving and restoring nature and ecosystems, including forests, mountains and other terrestrial and marine and coastal ecosystems, which may offer economic, social and environmental benefits such as improved resilience and well-being, and that adaptation can contribute to mitigating impacts and losses, as part of a country-driven gender-responsive and participatory approach, building on the best available science as well as Indigenous Peoples’ knowledge and local knowledge systems;
				56.	Notes that ecosystem-based approaches, including ocean-based adaptation and resilience measures, as well as in mountain regions, can reduce a range of climate change risks and provide multiple co-benefits;
				57.	Recalls that, as provided in Article 7, paragraphs 10–11, of the Paris Agreement, each Party should, as appropriate, submit and update an adaptation communication, that the adaptation communication shall be, as appropriate, submitted and updated periodically, as a component of or in conjunction with other communications or documents, including a national adaptation plan, a nationally determined contribution as referred to in Article 4, paragraph 2, of the Paris Agreement and/or a national communication, and that Parties may, as appropriate, also submit and update their adaptation communication as a component of or in conjunction with the reports on impacts and adaptation as stipulated in Article 13, paragraph 8, of the Paris Agreement;
				58.	Also recalls that the guidance on adaptation communications is to be reviewed in 2025;
				59.	Calls on Parties that have not yet done so to have in place their national adaptation plans, policies and planning processes by 2025 and to have progressed in implementing them by 2030;
			60.	Requests the secretariat to prepare a regular synthesis report on adaptation information provided by Parties in their biennial transparency reports, adaptation communications and nationally determined contributions;
				61.	Stresses the importance of global solidarity in undertaking adaptation efforts, including long-term transformational and incremental adaptation, towards reducing vulnerability and enhancing adaptive capacity and resilience, as well as the collective well-being of all people, the protection of livelihoods and economies, and the preservation and regeneration of nature, for current and future generations, in the context of the temperature goal referred to in Article 2 of the Paris Agreement, and that such efforts should be inclusive in terms of adaptation approaches and taking into account the best available science and the worldviews and values of Indigenous Peoples, to support achievement of the global goal on adaptation;
				62.	Calls on Parties to enhance their adaptation efforts in line with what is needed to achieve the goal in Article 2, paragraph 1(b), of the Paris Agreement and the global goal on adaptation, taking into account the United Arab Emirates Framework for Global Climate Resilience referred to in decision 2/CMA.5;
				63.	Urges Parties and invites non-Party stakeholders to increase ambition and enhance adaptation action and support, in line with decision 2/CMA.5, in order to accelerate swift action at scale and at all levels, from local to global, in alignment with other global frameworks, towards the achievement of, inter alia, the following targets by 2030, and progressively beyond:
					(a)	Significantly reducing climate-induced water scarcity and enhancing climate resilience to water-related hazards towards a climate-resilient water supply, climate-resilient sanitation and access to safe and affordable potable water for all;
					(b)	Attaining climate-resilient food and agricultural production and supply and distribution of food, as well as increasing sustainable and regenerative production and equitable access to adequate food and nutrition for all;
					(c)	Attaining resilience against climate change related health impacts, promoting climate-resilient health services and significantly reducing climate-related morbidity and mortality, particularly in the most vulnerable communities;
					(d)	Reducing climate impacts on ecosystems and biodiversity and accelerating the use of ecosystem-based adaptation and nature-based solutions, including through their management, enhancement, restoration and conservation and the protection of terrestrial, inland water, mountain, marine and coastal ecosystems;
					(e)	Increasing the resilience of infrastructure and human settlements to climate change impacts to ensure basic and continuous essential services for all, and minimizing climate-related impacts on infrastructure and human settlements;
					(f)	Substantially reducing the adverse effects of climate change on poverty eradication and livelihoods, in particular by promoting the use of adaptive social protection measures for all;
					(g)	Protecting cultural heritage from the impacts of climate-related risks by developing adaptive strategies for preserving cultural practices and heritage sites and by designing climate-resilient infrastructure, guided by traditional knowledge, Indigenous Peoples’ knowledge and local knowledge systems;
			64.	Affirms that the framework for the global goal on adaptation includes the following targets in relation to the dimensions of the iterative adaptation cycle, recognizing the need to enhance adaptation action and support:
				(a)	Impact, vulnerability and risk assessment: by 2030 all Parties have conducted up-to-date assessments of climate hazards, climate change impacts and exposure to risks and vulnerabilities and have used the outcomes of these assessments to inform their formulation of national adaptation plans, policy instruments, and planning processes and/or strategies, and by 2027 all Parties have established multi-hazard early warning systems, climate information services for risk reduction and systematic observation to support improved climate-related data, information and services;
				(b)	Planning: by 2030 all Parties have in place country-driven, gender-responsive, participatory and fully transparent national adaptation plans, policy instruments, and planning processes and/or strategies, covering, as appropriate, ecosystems, sectors, people and vulnerable communities, and have mainstreamed adaptation in all relevant strategies and plans;
				(c)	Implementation: by 2030 all Parties have progressed in implementing their national adaptation plans, policies and strategies and, as a result, have reduced the social and economic impacts of the key climate hazards identified in the assessments referred to in paragraph ‎64‎(a) above;
				(d)	Monitoring, evaluation and learning: by 2030 all Parties have designed, established and operationalized a system for monitoring, evaluation and learning for their national adaptation efforts and have built the required institutional capacity to fully implement the system;
			65.	Also affirms that efforts in relation to the targets referred to in paragraphs ‎63–‎64 above shall be made in a manner that is country-driven, voluntary and in accordance with national circumstances, take into account sustainable development and poverty eradication, and do not constitute a basis for comparison between Parties;
			C.	Means of implementation and support
				1.	Finance
					66.	Recalls Articles 2, 4 and 9, paragraphs 1–4, of the Paris Agreement;
					67.	Highlights the growing gap between the needs of developing country Parties, in particular those due to the increasing impacts of climate change compounded by difficult macroeconomic circumstances, and the support provided and mobilized for their efforts to implement their nationally determined contributions, highlighting that such needs are currently estimated at USD 5.8–5.9 trillion for the pre-2030 period;
					68.	Also highlights that the adaptation finance needs of developing countries are estimated at USD 215–387 billion annually up until 2030, and that about USD 4.3 trillion per year needs to be invested in clean energy up until 2030, increasing thereafter to USD 5 trillion per year up until 2050, to be able to reach net zero emissions by 2050;
					69.	Notes that scaling up new and additional grant-based, highly concessional finance and non-debt instruments remains critical to supporting developing countries, particularly as they transition in a just and equitable manner, and recognizes that there is a positive connection between having sufficient fiscal space, and climate action and advancing on a pathway towards low emissions and climate-resilient development, building on existing institutions and mechanisms such as the Common Framework;
					70.	Also recognizes the role of the private sector and highlights the need to strengthen policy guidance, incentives, regulations and enabling conditions to reach the scale of investments required to achieve a global transition towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development and encourages Parties to continue enhancing their enabling environments;
					71.	Recalls that developed country Parties shall provide financial resources to assist developing country Parties with respect to both mitigation and adaptation in continuation of their existing obligations under the Convention and that other Parties are encouraged to provide, or continue to provide, such support voluntarily;
					72.	Also recalls that, as part of a global effort, developed country Parties should continue to take the lead in mobilizing climate finance from a wide variety of sources, instruments and channels, noting the significant role of public funds, through a variety of actions, including supporting country-driven strategies, and taking into account the needs and priorities of developing country Parties, and that such mobilization of climate finance should represent a progression beyond previous efforts;
					73.	Reiterates that support shall be provided to developing country Parties for the implementation of Article 4 of the Paris Agreement, in accordance with Articles 9–11 of the Paris Agreement, recognizing that enhanced support for developing country Parties will allow for higher ambition in their actions;
					74.	Also reiterates the urgency to support the implementation of the Paris Agreement in developing countries;
					75.	Emphasizes the ongoing challenges faced by many developing country Parties in accessing climate finance and encourages further efforts, including by the operating entities of the Financial Mechanism, to simplify access to such finance, in particular for those developing country Parties that have significant capacity constraints, such as the least developed countries and small island developing States;
					76.	Welcomes recent progress made by developed countries in the provision and mobilization of climate finance, notes the increase in climate finance from developed countries in 2021 to USD 89.6 billion and the likelihood of meeting the goal in 2022 and looks forward to further information on the positive progress;
					77.	Notes the efforts of developed country Parties to make progress in at least doubling adaptation finance from 2019 levels by 2025;
					78.	Welcomes the pledges made by 31 contributors during the second replenishment of the Green Climate Fund, resulting in a nominal pledge of USD 12.833 billion to date, and encourages further pledges and contributions towards the second replenishment of the Fund, welcoming the progression over the previous replenishment;
					79.	Welcomes the pledges made to date for the operationalization of the funding arrangements, including the Fund, referred to in decisions 1/CP.28 and 5/CMA.5 amounting to USD 792 million, for the Adaptation Fund amounting to USD 187.74 million and the pledges to the Least Developed Countries Fund and the Special Climate Change Fund amounting to USD 179.06 million, and commends the efforts of the President of the Conference of the Parties at its twenty-eighth session in this regard;
					80.	Notes with deep regret that the goal of developed country Parties to mobilize jointly USD 100 billion per year by 2020 in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation was not met in 2021, including owing to challenges in mobilizing finance from private sources, and welcomes the ongoing efforts of developed country Parties towards achieving the goal of mobilizing jointly USD 100 billion per year;
					81.	Notes with concern that the adaptation finance gap is widening, and that current levels of climate finance, technology development and transfer, and capacity-building for adaptation remain insufficient to respond to worsening climate change impacts in developing country Parties, especially those that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change;
					82.	Recognizes the importance of the operating entities of the Financial Mechanism and the Adaptation Fund in the climate finance architecture, welcomes the new pledges to the Fund made at this session, urges all contributors to fulfil their pledges in a timely manner and invites the contributors to ensure the sustainability of the resources of the Fund, including the share of proceeds;
					83.	Strongly urges the operating entities of the Financial Mechanism to make full use of their current replenishment, calls on multilateral development banks and other financial institutions to further scale up investments in climate action and calls for a continued increase in the scale, and effectiveness of, and simplified access to, climate finance, including in the form of grants and other highly concessional forms of finance;

Annex I
	Governing Instrument of the Fund
		1.	The Fund is hereby operationalized in accordance with the following provisions.
		I.	Objectives and purpose
			2.	The purpose of the Fund is to assist developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change in responding to economic and non-economic loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change, including extreme weather events and slow onset events.
			3.	Given the urgent and immediate need for new, additional, predictable and adequate financial resources to assist developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change in responding to economic and non-economic loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change, including extreme weather events and slow onset events, especially in the context of ongoing and ex post (including rehabilitation, recovery and reconstruction) action, the Fund aims to be a new channel for multilateral finance to assist those countries in responding to loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change. The Fund will also endeavour to assist those countries in mobilizing external finance to strengthen their efforts to respond to loss and damage while supporting both the achievement of international goals on sustainable development and the eradication of poverty.
			4.	The Fund should operate in a manner that promotes coherence and complementarity with new and existing funding arrangements for responding to loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change across the international financial, climate, humanitarian, disaster risk reduction and development architectures. In accordance with the provisions set out in chapter ‎VI below, the Fund will develop new coordination and cooperation mechanisms to help enhance complementarity and coherence and will facilitate linkages between itself and various funding sources, including relevant vertical funds, as appropriate, to, inter alia, promote access to available funding, avoid duplication and reduce fragmentation.
			5.	The Fund will operate in a transparent and accountable manner guided by efficiency and effectiveness and sound financial management. The Fund will pursue a country ownership approach to programmes and projects and seek to promote and strengthen national response systems through, among other means, the effective involvement of relevant institutions and stakeholders, including non-State actors. The Fund should be scalable and flexible; practise continuous learning, guided by monitoring and evaluation processes; strive to maximize the impact of its funding for responding to loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change while promoting environmental, social, economic and development co-benefits; and take a culturally sensitive and gender-responsive approach.
		II.	Scope
			6.	The Fund will provide finance for addressing a variety of challenges associated with the adverse effects of climate change, such as climate-related emergencies, sea level rise, displacement, relocation, migration, insufficient climate information and data, and the need for climate-resilient reconstruction and recovery.
			7.	The Fund will focus on priority gaps within the current landscape of institutions, including global, regional and national institutions, that are funding activities related to responding to loss and damage. To this end, the Fund will provide complementary and additional support and improve the speed and adequacy of access to finance for responding to loss and damage by particularly vulnerable developing countries.
			8.	The Fund will provide support for responding to economic and non-economic loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change. This support may include funding that is complementary to humanitarian actions taken immediately after an extreme weather event; funding for intermediate or long-term recovery, reconstruction or rehabilitation; and funding for actions that address slow onset events.
			9.	The support provided by the Fund may include developing national response plans; addressing insufficient climate information and data; and promoting equitable, safe and dignified human mobility in the form of displacement, relocation and migration in cases of temporary and permanent loss and damage.
		III.	Governance and institutional arrangements
			A.	Legal status
				10.	The Fund will possess international legal personality and appropriate legal capacity as is necessary for the exercise of its functions, the fulfilment of its objectives and the protection of its interests, in particular the capacity to enter into contracts, to acquire and dispose of movable and immovable property, and to institute legal proceedings in defence of its interests. The Fund will enjoy such privileges and immunities as are necessary for the independent fulfilment of its purpose. The officials of the Fund’s secretariat will similarly enjoy such privileges and immunities as are necessary for the independent exercise of their official duties.

		I.	Objective and scope
			1.	The purpose of the new funding arrangements, which complement and include sources, funds, processes and initiatives under and outside the Convention and the Paris Agreement, is to assist developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change in responding to loss and damage, including with a focus on addressing loss and damage by providing and assisting in mobilizing new and additional resources, including for addressing extreme weather events and slow onset events, especially in the context of ongoing and ex post action.
			2.	The new funding arrangements include scaling up or enhancing existing and initiating new funding arrangements for responding to loss and damage.
			3.	The new funding arrangements will focus on providing and assisting in mobilizing new and additional resources while complementing sources, funds, processes and initiatives under and outside the Convention and the Paris Agreement.
		II.	Coordination and complementarity
			4.	The funding arrangements will increase the coherence of and coordination across the loss and damage finance architecture. They will contribute to avoiding the duplication of effort, maximizing and leveraging comparative advantages, sharing best practices and promoting synergies among the communities of practice related to loss and damage while continuing to assist in mobilizing new, additional and predictable financial resources.
			5.	The funding arrangements should ensure coordination at the national and regional level while also ensuring coherence at the operational level and in programmatic approaches.
			6.	The funding arrangements are to work in a manner coherent with and complementary to the fund established in paragraph 3 of decisions 2/CP.27 and 2/CMA.4 (hereinafter referred to as the Fund), which will be made possible through the best use of existing mechanisms, such as the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage associated with Climate Change Impacts (WIM) and the Santiago network for averting, minimizing and addressing loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change.
			7.	The Santiago network and its members should contribute to the above-mentioned coherence by aligning technical assistance catalysed under the network with efforts to build capacity and support the programmatic approaches of the Fund and the funding arrangements, as appropriate.
			A.	Relationship of the new funding arrangements with the Fund
				8.	The Fund will act as the platform for facilitating coordination and complementarity under the funding arrangements by establishing and operationalizing the high-level dialogue outlined in chapter ‎II.‎B below.
				9.	The Board of the Fund is encouraged to create an approach to developing partnerships with other entities that form part of the funding arrangements.
				10.	The Board is requested to develop standard procedures informed, inter alia, by the work of the WIM to identify sources, funds, processes and initiatives under and outside the Convention and the Paris Agreement that are assisting developing countries in responding to loss and damage from sudden or slow onset events, including economic or non-economic loss and damage (i.e. funding arrangements), for the purpose of supporting strengthened coordination and complementarity.
			B.	High-level dialogue
				11.	An annual high-level dialogue on coordination and complementarity (the dialogue) with representatives from the main entities that form part of the funding arrangements will be organized to:
					(a)	Facilitate a structured and timely exchange of relevant knowledge and information, including between the entities that form part of the funding arrangements and the Fund;
					(b)	Strengthen capacity and synergies to enhance the integration of measures to respond to loss and damage into sources, funds, processes and initiatives under and outside the Convention and the Paris Agreement by drawing on the experience of others, exchanging good policies and practices, and leveraging research and data systems;
					(c)	Promote the exchange of country and community experience in undertaking action to respond to loss and damage;
					(d)	Identify priority gaps and new opportunities for cooperation, coordination and complementarity;
					(e)	Develop recommendations on scaling up or enhancing existing as well as initiating new funding arrangements for responding to loss and damage.
				12.	The Board of the Fund will report on the dialogue through its annual report to the Conference of the Parties (COP) and the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement (CMA), and will include in the report information on actions to implement the recommendations arising from the dialogue, as well as recommendations on new funding arrangements.
				13.	The dialogue will be co-convened by the Fund and the United Nations Secretary-General, which may jointly designate a high-level representative that has the power to convene the entities that form part of the funding arrangements engaged in responding to loss and damage.
				14.	The dialogue will consist of no more than 30 high-level representatives of entities engaged in responding to loss and damage that form part of the new funding arrangements, invited by the co-conveners of the dialogue, including representatives of, inter alia:

				15.	The dialogue is to provide recommendations related to enhancing implementation of the objectives of the new funding arrangements in line with relevant COP and CMA decisions.
				16.	The dialogue will consider any comments or guidance from the COP and the CMA and will follow up on recommendations arising from previous dialogues.
		III.	Recommended actions with regard to the funding arrangements
			17.	Parties and relevant institutions should consider, as appropriate, developing and implementing additional funding arrangements for improving sources, funds, processes and initiatives under and outside the Convention and the Paris Agreement to address gaps in the speed of disbursement of, eligibility for, adequacy of and access to finance, especially pre-arranged finance, for responding to various challenges, such as climate-related emergencies, slow onset events, displacement, relocation, migration, insufficient climate information and data, and the need for climate-resilient reconstruction and recovery.
			18.	A wide variety of sources, including innovative sources, should be made available to support and complement the new and existing arrangements, including sources, funds, processes and initiatives under and outside the Convention and the Paris Agreement, and they should be made available in ways that ensure the new and existing funding arrangements target people and communities in climate-vulnerable situations (including women, children, youth, Indigenous Peoples, and climate-induced migrants and refugees in developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change).
			19.	The Santiago network and its members should contribute to coherence by aligning the technical assistance catalysed under the network with efforts to build capacity and support programmatic approaches of the Fund and the funding arrangements.
			20.	The entities that form part of the funding arrangements should explore ways of better coordinating all channels of finance, including bilateral, regional and multilateral channels, with the aim of improving synergies and coherence among the existing and new arrangements for responding to loss and damage.
			21.	Initiatives such as Early Warnings for All, Climate Risk and Early Warning Systems, the Systematic Observations Financing Facility and the Global Shield against Climate Risks are welcome, and relevant actors are encouraged to increase their support for activities that enhance response to loss and damage.
