Annex I
Recommendations forwarded by the forum pertaining to activity 1 of the workplan: exploring approaches to inform the development and implementation of climate change mitigation strategies, plans, policies and programmes that maximize the positive and minimize the negative impacts of response measures
	1.	Encourage Parties to engage relevant stakeholders at each step of the process of designing and implementing climate mitigation policies and policies to achieve sustainable development, including through social dialogue, when possible and subject to national circumstances. The relevant stakeholders among others include workers, employers, organizations, academia, the public and private sectors, women and civil society.
	2.	Encourage Parties to explore complementary policies, such as economic policies, social protection and labour policies, to help strengthen the outcomes of the implementation of mitigation strategies, plans, policies and programmes, including nationally determined contributions and low-emission development strategies.
	3.	Encourage Parties to strengthen international and regional cooperation as it contributes to planning and implementation of mitigation policies with environmental and socioeconomic benefits, for example to help facilitate technology development and transfer in accordance with Article 10 of the Paris Agreement, and strive towards harmonized regional approaches.
	4.	Encourage Parties to use existing qualitative and quantitative assessment methodologies and tools to understand social, economic and employment effects of proposed mitigation measures as a way to inform and guide climate policies and to maximize the positive and minimize the negative effects of the implementation of response measures. More analysis of impacts, including, inter alia, sectoral, national, subnational, domestic and cross border, would be useful for informing climate policies and understanding how to maximize the positive and minimize the negative effects of the implementation of response measures.
	5.	Encourage the forum and its Katowice Committee of Experts on the Impacts of the Implementation of Response Measures to enhance the capacity of Parties, particularly developing country Parties, through training and capacity-building efforts, including existing initiatives. This will enable Parties to carry out their own assessments and analyses of the impacts of response measures.
