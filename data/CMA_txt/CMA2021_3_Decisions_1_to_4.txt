Mechanism methodologies shall encourage ambition over time; encourage broad participation; be real, transparent, conservative, credible and below ‘business as usual’; avoid leakage, where applicable; recognize suppressed demand; align with the long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement; contribute to the equitable sharing of mitigation benefits between the participating Parties; and, in respect of each participating Party, contribute to reducing emission levels in the host Party, and align with its NDC, if applicable, its long-term low GHG emission development strategy, if it has submitted one, and the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement.
				34.	Mechanism methodologies shall include relevant assumptions, parameters, data sources and key factors and take into account uncertainty, leakage, policies and measures, and relevant circumstances, including national, regional or local, social, economic, environmental and technological circumstances, and address reversals, where applicable.
				35.	Mechanism methodologies may be developed by activity participants, host Parties, stakeholders or the Supervisory Body. Mechanism methodologies shall be approved by the Supervisory Body where they meet the requirements of these rules, modalities and procedures and the requirements established by the Supervisory Body.
				36.

Standardized baselines shall be established at the highest possible level of aggregation in the relevant sector of the host Party and be consistent with paragraph 33 above.
				38.	Each mechanism methodology shall specify the approach to demonstrating the additionality of the activity. Additionality shall be demonstrated using a robust assessment that shows the activity would not have occurred in the absence of the incentives from the mechanism, taking into account all relevant national policies, including legislation, and representing mitigation that exceeds any mitigation that is required by law or regulation, and taking a conservative approach that avoids locking in levels of emissions, technologies or carbon-intensive practices incompatible with paragraph 33 above.
