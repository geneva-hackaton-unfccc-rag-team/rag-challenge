New collective quantified goal on climate finance
	The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement,
		Recalling Article 9 of the Paris Agreement,
		Also recalling Article 2, paragraph 1, of the Paris Agreement, which sets out the goals of the Paris Agreement, and Article 2, paragraph 2, of the Paris Agreement, which provides that the Agreement will be implemented to reflect equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances,
		Further recalling decision 1/CP.21, paragraph 53,
		Recalling decisions 14/CMA.1, 9/CMA.3, 5/CMA.4 and 8/CMA.5,
		1.	Affirms that the new collective quantified goal on climate finance is aimed at contributing to accelerating the achievement of Article 2 of the Paris Agreement of holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change; increasing the ability to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change and foster climate resilience and low greenhouse gas emission development in a manner that does not threaten food production; and making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development;
		2.	Reaffirms the outcomes of the first global stocktake and stresses the urgency of enhancing ambition and action in this critical decade to address the gaps in the implementation of the goals of the Paris Agreement;
		3.	Highlights that costed needs reported in nationally determined contributions of developing country Parties are estimated at USD 5.1–6.8 trillion for up until 2030 or USD 455–584 billion per year and adaptation finance needs are estimated at USD 215–387 billion annually for up until 2030 and notes with concern the gap between climate finance flows and needs, particularly for adaptation in developing country Parties;
		4.	Notes the findings of the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, including the urgency of climate action; that finance, technology and international cooperation are critical enablers for accelerated climate action; that if climate goals are to be achieved, both adaptation and mitigation financing would need to be increased manyfold; and that there is sufficient global capital to close the global investment gap but there are barriers to redirecting capital to climate action, and that governments, through public funding and clear signals to investors, are key in reducing these barriers;
		5.	Decides that the new collective quantified goal on climate finance will support the implementation of developing country Parties’, inter alia, nationally determined contributions, national adaptation plans and adaptation communications, including those submitted as adaptation components of nationally determined contributions; contribute to increasing and accelerating ambition; and reflect the evolving needs and priorities of developing country Parties, especially those that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change and have significant capacity constraints, such as the least developed countries and small island developing States;
		6.	Reiterates the importance of reforming the multilateral financial architecture and underscores the need to remove barriers and address disenablers faced by developing country Parties in financing climate action, including high costs of capital, limited fiscal space, unsustainable debt levels, high transaction costs and conditionalities for accessing climate finance;
		7.	Calls on all actors to work together to enable the scaling up of financing to developing country Parties for climate action from all public and private sources to at least USD 1.3 trillion per year by 2035;
		8.	Reaffirms, in this context, Article 9 of the Paris Agreement and decides to set a goal, in extension of the goal referred to in paragraph 53 of decision 1/CP.21, with developed country Parties taking the lead, of at least USD 300 billion per year by 2035 for developing country Parties for climate action:
			(a)	From a wide variety of sources, public and private, bilateral and multilateral, including alternative sources;
			(b)	In the context of meaningful and ambitious mitigation and adaptation action, and transparency in implementation;
			(c)	Recognizing the voluntary intention of Parties to count all climate-related outflows from and climate-related finance mobilized by multilateral development banks towards achievement of the goal set forth in this paragraph;
		9.	Encourages developing country Parties to make contributions, including through South–South cooperation, on a voluntary basis;
		10.	Affirms that nothing in paragraphs 8–9 above affects any Party’s development or recipient status;
		11.	Underscores the importance of continuing to use bilateral channels to support climate action in developing country Parties, taking into account their needs and priorities in line with country-driven strategies and plans;
		12.	Encourages Parties, in carrying out their functions as shareholders of multilateral development banks, to continue advancing efforts to promote an evolution agenda for bigger, better and more effective multilateral development banks in order to address global challenges and poverty eradication and maximize impact in developing country Parties;
		13.	Recognizes that multilateral climate funds, including the operating entities of the Financial Mechanism, the Adaptation Fund, the Least Developed Countries Fund and the Special Climate Change Fund, are key in supporting developing country Parties and encourages Parties to work through the governing bodies on which they serve to continue enhancing climate finance, including with respect to coherence, complementarity and access;
		14.	Acknowledges the fiscal constraints and increasing costs to adapt to the adverse effects of climate change and, in this context, also acknowledges the need for public and grant-based resources and highly concessional finance, particularly for adaptation and responding to loss and damage in developing country Parties, especially those that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change and have significant capacity constraints, such as the least developed countries and small island developing States;
		15.	Underscores the critical importance of significantly reducing the cost of capital and increasing the mobilization ratio of finance mobilized from public sources by 2030 and creating fiscal space in developing country Parties through the use of innovative instruments, such as first-loss instruments, guarantees, local currency financing and foreign exchange risk instruments, taking into account national circumstances, and encourages the exploration, use and scaling up of innovative sources and instruments of finance, as appropriate;
		16.	Decides that a significant increase of public resources should be provided through the operating entities of the Financial Mechanism, the Adaptation Fund, the Least Developed Countries Fund and the Special Climate Change Fund and also decides to pursue efforts to at least triple annual outflows from those Funds from 2022 levels by 2030 at the latest with a view to significantly scaling up the share of finance delivered through them in delivering on the goal contained in paragraph 8 above;
		17.	Affirms that the provision of scaled-up financial resources should aim to achieve a balance between adaptation and mitigation, taking into account country-driven strategies, and the needs and priorities of developing country Parties, especially those that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change and have significant capacity constraints, such as the least developed countries and small island developing States;
		18.	Recognizes the need to dramatically scale up adaptation finance, including taking into account the global goal on adaptation and the targets referred to in paragraphs 9–10 of decision 2/CMA.5;
		19.	Acknowledges the significant gaps that remain in responding to the increased scale and frequency of loss and damage, and the associated economic and non-economic losses and recognizes the need for urgent and enhanced action and support for averting, minimizing and addressing loss and damage associated with climate change impacts;
		20.	Also recognizes the importance of continued efforts to support just transitions across all sectors and thematic areas, and cross-cutting efforts, including transparency, readiness, capacity-building and technology development and transfer, in developing country Parties;
		21.	Underscores the importance of reducing existing constraints, challenges, systemic inequities and barriers to access to climate finance, such as high cost of capital, co-financing requirements and burdensome application processes, welcomes ongoing efforts to improve access to climate finance and urges all climate finance actors to strengthen their efforts to enhance efficient and effective access to bilateral, regional and multilateral climate finance for developing countries, in line with country-driven strategies and plans, in particular the least developed countries and small island developing States, to eliminate conditionalities for access, as appropriate, and to enhance transparency regarding efforts undertaken in this regard;
		22.	Also urges Parties that provide bilateral climate finance to apply access enhancements, as appropriate and where relevant, including, in particular, by:
			(a)	Increasing, as appropriate, support for locally led approaches and institutions, in particular for adaptation measures;
			(b)	Enhancing sustained demand-led capacity-building, technical assistance and readiness programmes;
