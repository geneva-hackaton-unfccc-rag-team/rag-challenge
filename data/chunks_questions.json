international transaction log and a methodology for the collection of its fees for the biennium 2018–2019\n\t\t\tThe Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol,\n\t\t\tRecalling Article 13, paragraph 5, of the Kyoto Protocol,\n\t\t\tAlso recalling decisions 11/CMP.3, 10/CMP.5, 9/CMP.6, 8/CMP.8 and 8/CMP.11,\n\t\t\tRecognizing the importance of sufficient and stable funding for the international transaction log,\n\t\t\tAlso recognizing the importance of the proper functioning of the international transaction log for the Parties listed in Annex B to the Kyoto Protocol as contained in annex I to decision 1/CMP.8 (hereinafter in this decision referred to as Parties),\n\t\t\t1.\tApproves the budget for the international transaction log for the biennium 2018–2019, amounting to EUR 5,204,520, for the purposes specified in the proposed budget for the international transaction log;\n\t\t\t2.\tDecides to maintain the level of the working capital reserve at 8.3 per cent of the estimated expenditure for the Trust Fund for the International Transaction Log;\n\t\t\t3.\tAuthorizes the Executive Secretary to draw EUR 2.5 million from unspent balances of the Trust Fund for the International Transaction Log from previous financial periods to cover part of the budget for the biennium 2018–2019;\n\t\t\t4.\tAlso authorizes the Executive Secretary to draw funds from unspent balances of the Trust Fund for the International Transaction Log from previous financial periods to cover the potential shortfall in fees due to the disconnection of Parties from the international transaction log;\n\t\t\t5.\tNotes that the action referred to in paragraph 3 above is exceptional and is needed to disburse the significant unspent funds, and recognizes that fees for the operation of the international transaction log are to be levied as necessary in future bienniums;\n\t\t\t6.\tAlso notes that any unspent balances of the Trust Fund for the International Transaction Log from previous financial periods remaining after the actions referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 above could be used to cover the budget of the international transaction log for future bienniums;\n\t\t\t7.\tRequests the administrator of the international transaction log to disclose in its annual reports the unspent balance of the Trust Fund for the International Transaction Log from the previous biennium as at the time of publication of the annual report;\n\t\t\t8.\tAdopts the scale of fees for the international transaction log for the biennium 2018–2019 as contained in the annex;\n\t\t\t9.\tDecides that fees for the international transaction log paid by a Party for the biennium 2018–2019 shall be calculated by multiplying the scale of fees for that Party contained in the annex by the budget for the international transaction log for the biennium 2018–2019 and adjusted for Parties currently not connected to the international transaction log, taking into account the amount drawn from unspent balances as set out in paragraph 3 above, with the balance of fees for the first year of the biennium being equal to the balance of fees for the second year of the biennium, as contained in the annex;\n\t\t\t10.\tRequests the Executive Secretary to notify Parties connected to the international transaction log in the biennium 2018–2019 of the annual fees, calculated in accordance with paragraph 9 above, as early as possible and at least four months in advance of the relevant calendar year, where possible;\n\t\t\t11.\tDecides that, if a Party connects to the international transaction log for the first time or reconnects to it, the scale of fees for that Party shall be that contained in the annex, or, for Parties not listed in the table contained in the annex, shall be made equal to 130 per cent of their Kyoto Protocol adjusted scale for the relevant biennium;\n\t\t\t12.\tAlso decides that fees paid by a Party that connects to the international transaction log for the first time or reconnects to it shall be deducted from the resource requirement for activities relating to the international transaction log in the next biennium;\n\t\t\t13.\tFurther decides that fees paid by a Party that connects to the international transaction log for the first time or reconnects to it during the biennium 2018–2019 shall be proportioned for the period between the date of connection or reconnection of its registry and the end of the biennium, except for the period for which the fees were already paid;\n\t\t\t14.\tDecides that, where a Party disconnects during the biennium 2018–2019, the Party shall cover the fees for the full year in which the disconnection took place, and that, if the disconnection takes place in the first year of the biennium and the Party does not reconnect in the second year of the biennium, fees for the second year of the biennium shall not apply;\n\t\t\t15.\tAlso decides that, where a Party disconnected prior to the biennium 2018–2019, the fees shall not apply until the Party reconnects to the international transaction log;",

The relevant stakeholders among others include workers, employers, organizations, academia, the public and private sectors, women and civil society.\n\t\t2.\tEncourage Parties to explore complementary policies, such as economic policies, social protection and labour policies, to help strengthen the outcomes of the implementation of mitigation strategies, plans, policies and programmes, including nationally determined contributions and low-emission development strategies.\n\t\t3.\tEncourage Parties to strengthen international and regional cooperation as it contributes to planning and implementation of mitigation policies with environmental and socioeconomic benefits, for example to help facilitate technology development and transfer in accordance with Article 10 of the Paris Agreement, and strive towards harmonized regional approaches.\n\t\t4.\tEncourage Parties to use existing qualitative and quantitative assessment methodologies and tools to understand social, economic and employment effects of proposed mitigation measures as a way to inform and guide climate policies and to maximize the positive and minimize the negative effects of the implementation of response measures. More analysis of impacts, including, inter alia, sectoral, national, subnational, domestic and cross border, would be useful for informing climate policies and understanding how to maximize the positive and minimize the negative effects of the implementation of response measures.\n\t\t5.\tEncourage the forum and its Katowice Committee of Experts on the Impacts of the Implementation of Response Measures to enhance the capacity of Parties, particularly developing country Parties, through training and capacity-building efforts, including existing initiatives. This will enable Parties to carry out their own assessments and analyses of the impacts of response measures.\n\t\t\n\tAnnex II\n\t\tRevised rules of procedure of the Katowice Committee of Experts on the Impacts of the Implementation of Response Measures\n\t\tI.\tScope\n\t\t\t1.\tThese rules of procedure shall apply to the Katowice Committee of Experts on the Impacts of the Implementation of Response Measures (KCI) in accordance with decision 7/CMA.1 and its annex.\n\t\tII.\tMandate\n\t\t\t2.\tThe Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement (CMA), by decision 7/CMA.1, decided to establish the KCI to support the work of the forum on the impact of the implementation of response measures in implementing its work programme and operating in accordance with the terms of reference contained in the annex to that decision.\n\t\t\t3.\tThe forum and the KCI may use the following modalities, as appropriate and as decided on a case-by-case basis, to carry out the work programme of the forum:\n\t\t\t\t(a)\tBuilding awareness and enhancing information-sharing through the exchange and sharing of experience and best practices;\n\t\t\t\t(b)\tPreparing technical papers, case studies, specific examples and guidelines;\n\t\t\t\t(c)\tReceiving inputs from experts, practitioners and relevant organizations;\n\t\t\t\t(d)\tOrganizing workshops.\n\t\tIII.\tMembers\n\t\t\t4.\tThe CMA, by decision 7/CMA.1, decided that the KCI shall be composed of 14 members, of which:\n\t\t\t\t(a)\tTwo members from each of the five United Nations regional groups;\n\t\t\t\t(b)\tOne member from the least developed countries;\n\t\t\t\t(c)\tOne member from the small island developing States;\n\t\t\t\t(d)\tTwo members from relevant intergovernmental organizations.\n\t\t\t5.\tBy the same decision, the CMA also decided that members shall be nominated by their respective groups. Groups are encouraged to nominate members taking into account the goal of achieving gender balance. The Chairs of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) and the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) shall be notified of these appointments.\n\t\t\t6.\tThe CMA further decided that members shall serve in their expert capacity and should have relevant qualifications and expertise in the technical and socioeconomic fields related to the areas of the work programme of the forum.\n\t\t\t7.\tFurther, the CMA decided that members shall serve a term of two years and be eligible to serve a maximum of two consecutive terms in office.

biennium 2022–2023 and adjusted for Parties currently not connected to the international transaction log, taking into account the amount drawn from unspent balances as set out in paragraph 3 above,

least four months in advance of the relevant calendar year, where possible;\n\t\t\t11.\tDecides that, if a Party connects to the international transaction log for the first time or reconnects to it,

and the end of the biennium, except for the period for which the fees were already paid;\n\t\t\t14.\tDecides that, where a Party disconnects during the biennium 2022–2023, the Party shall cover the

    "answer": "The definition of key source category in paragraph 3(d) of decision 19/CMP.1 reads: ‘Key category is one that is prioritized within the national inventory because its estimate has a significant influence on a country’s total inventory of greenhouse gases in terms of the absolute level of emissions, the trend in emissions and removals, or uncertainty in emissions or removals. Whenever the term key category is used, it includes both source and sink categories.’"

increasing the ability to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change and foster climate resilience and low greenhouse gas emission development in a manner that does not threaten food production; and making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development;\n\t\t2.\tReaffirms the outcomes of the first global stocktake and stresses the urgency of enhancing ambition and action in this critical decade to address the gaps in the implementation of the goals of the Paris Agreement;\n\t\t3.\tHighlights that costed needs reported in nationally determined contributions of developing country Parties are estimated at USD 5.1–6.8 trillion for up until 2030 or USD 455–584 billion per year and adaptation finance needs are estimated at USD 215–387 billion annually for up until 2030 and notes with concern the gap between climate finance flows and needs, particularly for adaptation in developing country Parties;\n\t\t4.\tNotes the findings of the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, including the urgency of climate action; that finance, technology and international cooperation are critical enablers for accelerated climate action; that if climate goals are to be achieved, both adaptation and mitigation financing would need to be increased manyfold; and that there is sufficient global capital to close the global investment gap but there are barriers to redirecting capital to climate action, and that governments, through public funding and clear signals to investors, are key in reducing these barriers;\n\t\t5.\tDecides that the new collective quantified goal on climate finance will support the implementation of developing country Parties’, inter alia, nationally determined contributions, national adaptation plans and adaptation communications, including those submitted as adaptation components of nationally determined contributions; contribute to increasing and accelerating ambition; and reflect the evolving needs and priorities of developing country Parties, especially those that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change and have significant capacity constraints, such as the least developed countries and small island developing States;\n\t\t6.\tReiterates the importance of reforming the multilateral financial architecture and underscores the need to remove barriers and address disenablers faced by developing country Parties in financing climate action, including high costs of capital, limited fiscal space, unsustainable debt levels, high transaction costs and conditionalities for accessing climate finance;\n\t\t7.\tCalls on all actors to work together to enable the scaling up of financing to developing country Parties for climate action from all public and private sources to at least USD 1.3 trillion per year by 2035;\n\t\t8.\tReaffirms, in this context, Article 9 of the Paris Agreement and decides to set a goal, in extension of the goal referred to in paragraph 53 of decision 1/CP.21, with developed country Parties taking the lead, of at least USD 300 billion per year by 2035 for developing country Parties for climate action:\n\t\t\t(a)\tFrom a wide variety of sources, public and private, bilateral and multilateral, including alternative sources;\n\t\t\t(b)\tIn the context of meaningful and ambitious mitigation and adaptation action, and transparency in implementation;\n\t\t\t(c)\tRecognizing the voluntary intention of Parties to count all climate-related outflows from and climate-related finance mobilized by multilateral development banks towards achievement of the goal set forth in this paragraph;\n\t\t9.\tEncourages developing country Parties to make contributions, including through South–South cooperation, on a voluntary basis;\n\t\t10.\tAffirms that nothing in paragraphs 8–9 above affects any Party’s development or recipient status;\n\t\t11.\tUnderscores the importance of continuing to use bilateral channels to support climate action in developing country Parties, taking into account their needs and priorities in line with country-driven strategies and plans;\n\t\t12.\tEncourages Parties, in carrying out their functions as shareholders of multilateral development banks, to continue advancing efforts to promote an evolution agenda for bigger, better and more effective multilateral development banks in order to address global challenges and poverty eradication and maximize impact in developing country Parties;\n\t\t13.\tRecognizes that multilateral climate funds, including the operating entities of the Financial Mechanism, the Adaptation Fund, the Least Developed Countries Fund and the Special Climate Change Fund, are key in supporting developing country Parties and encourages Parties to work through the governing bodies on which they serve to continue enhancing climate finance, including with respect to coherence, complementarity and access;\n\t\t14.\tAcknowledges the fiscal constraints and increasing costs to adapt to the adverse effects of climate change and, in this context, also acknowledges the need for public and grant-based resources and highly concessional finance, particularly for adaptation and responding to loss and damage in developing country Parties, especially those that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change and have significant capacity constraints, such as the least developed countries and small island developing States;\n\t\t15.\tUnderscores the critical importance of significantly reducing the cost of capital and increasing the mobilization ratio of finance mobilized from public sources by 2030 and creating fiscal space in developing country Parties through the use of innovative instruments, such as first-loss instruments, guarantees, local currency financing and foreign exchange risk instruments, taking into account national circumstances, and encourages the exploration, use and scaling up of innovative sources and instruments of finance, as appropriate;",

ambition and responding to the threat of climate change;\n\t5.\tRe-emphasizes with serious concern the urgent need to address the significant gap between the aggregate effect of Parties’ mitigation efforts in terms of global annual emissions of greenhouse gases by 2020 and aggregate emission pathways consistent with holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels;\n\t6.\tRecalls that each Party’s successive nationally determined contribution will represent a progression beyond the Party’s then current nationally determined contribution and reflect its highest possible ambition, reflecting its common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances;\n\t7.\tAlso recalls the request to Parties contained in decision 1/CP.21, paragraphs 23–24, and urges Parties to consider the

financial resources to assist developing country Parties with respect to both mitigation and adaptation, in continuation of their existing obligations under the Convention, and encourages other Parties to provide or continue to provide such support voluntarily;\n\t17.\tRecalls that the provision of scaled-up financial resources should aim to achieve a balance between adaptation and mitigation, taking into account country-driven strategies, and the priorities and needs of developing country Parties, especially those that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of

paragraph 1, of the Paris Agreement, which provides that the Agreement, in enhancing the implementation of the Convention, including its objective, aims to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty,\n\tAlso recalling Article 2, paragraph 2, of the Paris Agreement, which provides that the Agreement will be implemented to reflect equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances,\n\tFurther recalling, as provided in Article 14, paragraph 1, of the Paris Agreement, that the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement shall periodically take stock of the implementation of the Paris Agreement to assess the collective progress towards achieving the purpose of the Agreement and its long-term goals, and that it shall do so in a comprehensive and facilitative manner, considering mitigation, adaptation and the means of implementation and support, and in the light of equity and the best available science,\n\tRecalling, as provided in Article 14, paragraph 3, of the Paris Agreement, that the outcome of the global stocktake shall inform Parties in updating and enhancing, in a nationally determined manner, their actions and support in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Agreement, as well as in enhancing international cooperation for climate action,\n\tAlso recalling decisions 19/CMA.1, 1/CMA.2, 1/CMA.3 and 1/CMA.4,\n\tUnderlining the critical role of multilateralism based on United Nations values and principles, including in the context of the implementation of the Convention and the Paris Agreement, and the importance of international cooperation for addressing global issues, including climate change, in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty,\n\tAcknowledging that climate change is a common concern of humankind and that Parties should, when taking action to address climate change, respect, promote and consider their respective obligations on human rights, the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment, the right to health, the rights of Indigenous Peoples, local communities, migrants, children, persons with disabilities and people in vulnerable situations and the right to development, as well as gender equality, empowerment of women and intergenerational equity,\n\tRecognizing the fundamental priority of safeguarding food security and ending hunger, and the particular vulnerabilities of food production systems to the adverse impacts of climate change,\n\tAlso recognizing the critical role of protecting, conserving and restoring water systems and water-related ecosystems in delivering climate adaptation benefits and co‑benefits, while ensuring social and environmental safeguards,\n\tNoting the importance of ensuring the integrity of all ecosystems, including in forests, the ocean, mountains and the cryosphere, and the protection of biodiversity, recognized by some cultures as Mother Earth, and also noting the importance of “climate justice”, when taking action to address climate change,\n\tUnderlining the urgent need to address, in a comprehensive and synergetic manner, the interlinked global crises of climate change and biodiversity loss in the broader context of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, as well as the vital importance of protecting, conserving, restoring and sustainably using nature and ecosystems for effective and sustainable climate action,\n\tI.\tContext and cross-cutting considerations\n\t\t1.\tWelcomes that the Paris Agreement has driven near-universal climate action by setting goals and sending signals to the world regarding the urgency of responding to the climate crisis;\n\t\t2.\tUnderlines that, despite overall progress on mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation and support, Parties are not yet collectively on track towards achieving the purpose of the Paris Agreement and its long-term goals;\n\t\t3.\tReaffirms the Paris Agreement temperature goal of holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change;\n\t\t4.\tUnderscores that the impacts of climate change will be much lower at the temperature increase of 1.5 °C compared with 2 °C and resolves to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C;\n\t\t5.\tExpresses serious concern that 2023 is set to be the warmest year on record and that impacts from climate change are rapidly accelerating and emphasizes the need for urgent action and support to keep the 1.5 °C goal within reach and to address the climate crisis in this critical decade;\n\t\t6.\tCommits to accelerate action in this critical decade on the basis of the best available science, reflecting equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities in the light of different national circumstances and in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty;\n\t\t7.\tUnderscores Article 2, paragraph 2, of the Paris Agreement, which stipulates that the Agreement will be implemented to reflect equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances;\n\t\t8.\tEmphasizes that finance, capacity-building and technology transfer are critical enablers of climate action;\n\t\t9.\tReaffirms that sustainable and just solutions to the climate crisis must be founded on meaningful and effective social dialogue and participation of all stakeholders, including Indigenous Peoples, local communities and governments,

vulnerable to the impacts, and, together with losses and damages, will increase with every increment of warming;\n\t\t\t(c)\tThat most observed adaptation responses are fragmented, incremental, sector-specific and unequally distributed across regions, and that, despite the progress made, significant adaptation gaps still exist across sectors and regions and will continue to grow under current levels of implementation;\n\t\t16.\tNotes the following findings of the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change:\n\t\t\t(a)\tThat mitigation efforts embedded within the wider development context can increase the pace, depth and breadth of emissions reductions, as well as that policies that shift development pathways towards sustainability can broaden the portfolio of available mitigation responses and enable the pursuit of synergies with development objectives;\n\t\t\t(b)\tThat both adaptation and mitigation financing would need to increase manyfold, and that there is sufficient global capital to close the global investment gap but there are barriers to redirecting capital to climate action, and that Governments through public funding and clear signals to investors are key in reducing these barriers, and investors, central banks and financial regulators can also play their part;\n\t\t\t(c)\tThat feasible, effective and low-cost mitigation options are already available in all sectors to keep 1.5 °C within reach in this critical decade with the necessary cooperation on technologies and support;\n\t\t17.\tNotes with concern the pre-2020 gaps in both mitigation ambition and implementation by developed country Parties and that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change had earlier indicated that developed countries must reduce emissions by 25–40 per cent below 1990 levels by 2020, which was not achieved;\n\tII.\tCollective progress towards achieving the purpose and long-term goals of the Paris Agreement, including under Article 2, paragraph 1(a–c), in the light of equity and the best available science, and informing Parties in updating and enhancing, in a nationally determined manner, action and support\n\t\tA.\tMitigation\n\t\t\t18.\tAcknowledges that significant collective progress towards the Paris Agreement temperature goal has been made, from an expected global temperature increase of 4 °C according to some projections prior to the adoption of the Agreement to an increase in the range of 2.1–2.8 °C with the full implementation of the latest nationally determined contributions;\n\t\t\t19.\tExpresses appreciation that all Parties have communicated nationally determined contributions that demonstrate progress towards achieving the Paris Agreement temperature goal, most of which provided the information necessary to facilitate their clarity, transparency and understanding;\n\t\t\t\t20.\tCommends the 68 Parties that have communicated long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies and notes that 87 per cent of the global economy in terms of share of gross domestic product is covered by targets for climate neutrality, carbon neutrality, greenhouse gas neutrality or net zero emissions, which provides the possibility of achieving a temperature increase below 2 °C when taking into account the full implementation of those strategies;\n\t\t\t\t21.\tNotes with concern the findings in the latest version of the synthesis report on nationally determined contributions that implementation of current nationally determined contributions would reduce emissions on average by 2 per cent compared with the 2019 level by 2030 and that significantly greater emission reductions are required to align with global greenhouse gas emission trajectories in line with the Paris Agreement temperature goal and recognizes the urgent need to address this gap;\n\t\t\t\t22.\tNotes the findings in the synthesis report on nationally determined contributions that greenhouse gas emission levels in 2030 are projected to be 5.3 per cent lower than in 2019 if all nationally determined contributions, including all conditional elements, are fully implemented and that enhanced financial resources, technology transfer and technical cooperation, and capacity-building support are needed to achieve this;\n\t\t\t\t23.\tNotes with concern the findings of the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that policies implemented by the end of 2020 are projected to result in higher global greenhouse gas emissions than those implied by the nationally determined contributions, indicating an implementation gap, and resolves to take action to urgently address this gap;\n\t\t\t24.\tNotes with significant concern that, despite progress, global greenhouse gas emissions trajectories are not yet in line with the Paris Agreement temperature goal, and that there is a rapidly narrowing window for raising ambition and implementing existing commitments in order to achieve it;\n\t\t\t25.\tExpresses concern that the carbon budget consistent with achieving the Paris Agreement temperature goal is now small and being rapidly depleted and acknowledges that historical cumulative net carbon dioxide emissions already account for about four fifths of the total carbon budget for a 50 per cent probability of limiting global warming to 1.5 °C;\n\t\t\t26.\tRecognizes the finding in the Synthesis Report of the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, based on global modelled pathways and assumptions, that global greenhouse gas emissions are projected to peak between 2020 and at the latest before 2025 in global modelled pathways that limit warming to 1.5 °C with no or limited overshoot and in those that limit warming to 2 °C and assume immediate action, notes that this does not imply peaking in all countries within this time frame, and that time frames for peaking may be shaped by sustainable development, poverty eradication needs and equity and be in line with different national circumstances and recognizes that technology development and transfer on voluntary and mutually agreed terms, as well as capacity-building and financing, can support countries in this regard;\n\t\t\t27.\tAlso recognizes that limiting global warming to 1.5 °C with no or limited overshoot requires deep, rapid and sustained reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions of 43 per cent by 2030 and 60 per cent by 2035 relative to the 2019 level and reaching net zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050;\n\t\t\t\t28.\tFurther recognizes the need for deep, rapid and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in line with 1.5 °C pathways and calls on Parties to contribute to the following global efforts, in a nationally determined manner, taking into account the Paris Agreement and their different national circumstances, pathways and approaches:\n\t\t\t\t\t(a)\tTripling renewable energy capacity globally and doubling the global average annual rate of energy efficiency improvements by 2030;\n\t\t\t\t\t(b)\tAccelerating efforts towards the phase-down of unabated coal power;\n\t\t\t\t\t(c)\tAccelerating efforts globally towards net zero emission energy systems, utilizing zero- and low-carbon fuels, well before or by around mid-century;\n\t\t\t\t\t(d)\tTransitioning away from fossil fuels in energy systems, in a just, orderly and equitable manner, accelerating action in this critical decade, so as to achieve net zero by 2050 in keeping with the science;\n\t\t\t\t\t(e)\tAccelerating zero- and low-emission technologies, including, inter alia, renewables, nuclear, abatement and removal technologies such as carbon capture and utilization and storage, particularly in hard-to-abate sectors, and low-carbon hydrogen production;\n\t\t\t\t\t(f)\tAccelerating the substantial reduction of non-carbon-dioxide emissions globally, in particular methane emissions by 2030;\n\t\t\t\t\t(g)\tAccelerating the reduction of emissions from road transport on a range of pathways, including through development of infrastructure and rapid deployment of zero‑ and low‑emission vehicles;\n\t\t\t\t\t(h)\tPhasing out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that do not address energy poverty or just transitions, as soon as possible;\n\t\t\t29.\tRecognizes that transitional fuels can play a role in facilitating the energy transition while ensuring energy security;\n\t\t\t30.\tWelcomes that over the past decade mitigation technologies have become increasingly available, and that the unit costs of several low-emission technologies have fallen continuously, notably wind power and solar power and storage, thanks to technological advancements, economies of scale, increased efficiency and streamlined manufacturing processes, while recognizing the need to increase the affordability and accessibility of such technologies;\n\t\t\t\t31.\tEmphasizes the urgent need for accelerated implementation of domestic mitigation measures in accordance with Article 4, paragraph 2, of the Paris Agreement, as well as the use of voluntary cooperation referred to in Article 6, paragraph 1, of the Paris Agreement;",

implementation of, support for and collective assessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of adaptation, and that monitoring and evaluation of outcomes is critical for tracking the progress and improving the quality and awareness of adaptation action;\n\t\t\t49.\tAcknowledges that establishing and improving national inventories of climate impacts over time and building accessible, user-driven climate services systems, including early warning systems, can strengthen the implementation of adaptation actions, and recognizes that one third of the world does not have access to early warning and climate information services, as well as the need to enhance coordination of activities by the systematic observation community;\n\t\t\t50.\tRecalls the United Nations Secretary-General’s call made on World Meteorological Day on 23 March 2022 to protect everyone on Earth through universal coverage of early warning systems against extreme weather and climate change by 2027 and invites

iterative adaptation cycle, recognizing the need to enhance adaptation action and support:\n\t\t\t\t(a)\tImpact, vulnerability and risk assessment: by 2030 all Parties have conducted up-to-date assessments of climate hazards, climate change impacts and exposure to risks and vulnerabilities and have used the outcomes of these assessments to inform their formulation of national adaptation plans, policy instruments, and planning processes and/or strategies, and by 2027 all Parties have established multi-hazard early warning systems, climate information services for risk reduction and systematic observation to support improved climate-related data, information and services;\n\t\t\t\t(b)\tPlanning: by 2030 all Parties have in place country-driven, gender-responsive, participatory and fully transparent national adaptation plans, policy instruments, and planning processes and/or strategies, covering, as appropriate, ecosystems, sectors, people and vulnerable communities, and have mainstreamed adaptation in all relevant strategies and plans;\n\t\t\t\t(c)\tImplementation: by 2030 all Parties have progressed in implementing their national adaptation plans, policies and strategies and, as a result, have reduced the social and economic impacts of the key climate hazards identified in the assessments referred to in paragraph ‎64‎(a) above;\n\t\t\t\t(d)\tMonitoring, evaluation and learning: by 2030 all Parties have designed, established and operationalized a system for monitoring, evaluation and learning for their national adaptation efforts and have built the

and mobilized for their efforts to implement their nationally determined contributions, highlighting that such needs are currently estimated at USD 5.8–5.9 trillion for the pre-2030 period;\n\t\t\t\t\t68.\tAlso highlights that the adaptation finance needs of developing countries are estimated at USD 215–387 billion annually up until 2030, and that about USD 4.3 trillion per year needs to be invested in clean energy up until 2030, increasing thereafter to USD 5 trillion per year up until 2050, to be able to reach net zero emissions by 2050;\n\t\t\t\t\t69.\tNotes that scaling up new and additional grant-based, highly concessional finance and non-debt instruments remains critical to supporting developing countries, particularly as they transition in a just and equitable

assist developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change in responding to economic and non-economic loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of

developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change in responding to economic and non-economic loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change, including extreme weather events and slow onset events, especially in the context of ongoing and ex post (including rehabilitation, recovery and reconstruction) action, the Fund aims to be a new channel for multilateral finance to assist those countries in responding to loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change. The Fund will also endeavour to assist those countries in mobilizing external finance to strengthen their efforts to respond to loss and damage while supporting both the achievement of international goals on sustainable development and the eradication of poverty.\n\t\t\t4.\tThe Fund should operate in a manner that promotes coherence and complementarity with new and existing funding arrangements for responding to loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change across the international financial, climate, humanitarian, disaster risk reduction and development architectures. In accordance with the provisions set out in chapter ‎VI below, the Fund will develop new coordination and cooperation mechanisms to help enhance complementarity and coherence and will facilitate linkages between itself and various funding sources, including relevant vertical funds, as appropriate, to, inter alia, promote access to available funding, avoid duplication and reduce fragmentation.\n\t\t\t5.\tThe Fund will operate in a transparent and accountable manner guided by efficiency and effectiveness and sound financial management. The Fund will pursue a country ownership approach to programmes and projects and seek to promote and strengthen national response systems through, among other means, the effective involvement of relevant institutions and stakeholders, including non-State actors. The Fund should be scalable and flexible; practise continuous learning, guided by monitoring and evaluation processes; strive to maximize the impact of its funding for responding to loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change while promoting environmental, social, economic and development co-benefits; and take a culturally sensitive and gender-responsive approach.\n\t\tII.\tScope\n\t\t\t6.\tThe Fund will provide finance for addressing a variety of challenges associated with the adverse effects of climate change, such as climate-related emergencies, sea level rise, displacement, relocation, migration, insufficient climate information and data, and the need for climate-resilient reconstruction and recovery.\n\t\t\t7.\tThe Fund will focus on priority gaps within the current landscape of institutions, including global, regional and national institutions, that are funding activities related to responding to loss and damage. To this end, the Fund will provide complementary and additional support and improve the speed and adequacy of access to finance for responding to loss and damage by particularly vulnerable developing countries.\n\t\t\t8.\tThe Fund will provide support for responding to economic and non-economic loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change. This support may include funding that is complementary to humanitarian actions taken immediately after an extreme weather event; funding for intermediate or long-term recovery, reconstruction or rehabilitation; and funding for actions that address slow onset events.\n\t\t\t9.\tThe support provided by the Fund may include developing national response plans; addressing insufficient climate information and data; and promoting equitable, safe and dignified human mobility in the form of displacement, relocation and migration in cases of temporary and permanent loss and damage.\n\t\tIII.\tGovernance and institutional arrangements\n\t\t\tA.\tLegal status\n\t\t\t\t10.\tThe Fund will possess international legal personality and appropriate legal capacity as is necessary for the exercise of its functions, the fulfilment of its objectives and the protection of its interests, in particular the capacity to enter into contracts, to acquire and dispose of movable and immovable property, and to institute legal proceedings in defence of its interests. The Fund will enjoy such privileges and immunities as are necessary for the independent fulfilment of its purpose. The officials of the Fund’s secretariat will similarly enjoy such privileges and immunities as are necessary for the independent exercise of their official duties.\n\t\t\tB.\tRelationship to the Conference of the Parties and the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement",
