He also informed Parties that he would work closely with the APA Co-Chairs as well to ensure that this aim would be met.
				5.	At the 6th meeting of the SBSTA, on 4 September, which was held jointly with the 6th meeting of the SBI and the 17th meeting of the APA, the presiding officers of the three bodies, responding to the Parties’ desire to start work immediately, confirmed on an exceptional basis and without any intention to set a precedent that statements would not be delivered in plenary, and encouraged Parties and observers to upload their statements to the submission and statement portal.
				6.	On 6 September, the SBSTA Chair, together with the SBI Chair and the APA Co-Chairs, convened a joint informal plenary to inform Parties of progress in the work of the SBSTA, the SBI and the APA pertaining to the PAWP and to discuss the way forward for the sessions.
	III.	Report on agenda items 4, 5, 9(b), 12(a–c) and 13
(Agenda items 4, 5, 9(b), 12(a–c) and 13)
		1.	Proceedings
		7.	The SBSTA considered these items at its 5th meeting as well as its 7th meeting, on 9 September.
		8.	At its 5th meeting, the SBSTA agreed to convene informal consultations on agenda item 5 (Development and transfer of technologies: technology framework under Article 10, paragraph 4 of the Paris Agreement), co-facilitated by Mr. Carlos Fuller (Belize) and Ms. Mette Moglestue (Norway).

		10.	At the same meeting, the SBSTA also agreed to:
			(a)	Convene, jointly with those of the SBI on its agenda item 11, informal consultations on agenda item 4 (Report of the Adaptation Committee), co-facilitated by Ms. Gabriela Fischerova (Slovakia) and Ms. Pepetua Latasi (Tuvalu);

		11.	At its 7th meeting, the Chair invited the above-mentioned co-chairs and co-facilitators to report back on the work conducted under the respective agenda items. The SBSTA then adopted the conclusions below, which were, mutatis mutandis, identical to the conclusions adopted by the SBI and the APA.
			2.	Conclusions
		12.	The SBSTA took note of the further progress made at SBSTA 48.2, aiming to complete its work on the PAWP in a timely manner and to forward the outcomes to the Conference of the Parties (COP) at its twenty-fourth session (December 2018) at the latest.
		13.	The SBSTA requested the secretariat to update, on the basis of the outcomes of this session (see the annex), the online platform referred to in paragraph 3 of decision 1/CP.23, which provides an overview of the work of the COP and the subsidiary and constituted bodies on the PAWP. The SBSTA agreed that the progress achieved at this session provides a useful basis for further negotiations by Parties on PAWP matters and their successful completion at COP 24.
		14.	The SBSTA agreed that the presiding officers of the APA, the SBI and the SBSTA should prepare a joint reflections note addressing progress made to date and identifying ways forward, including textual proposals that would be helpful for advancing Parties’ deliberations. The purpose of doing so would be to address all PAWP matters so as to ensure their balanced and coordinated consideration by the APA, the SBSTA and the SBI, and to facilitate successful completion of the PAWP at COP 24. To that end, the SBSTA requested its Chair to work closely with the other presiding officers on such a note and to release it by mid-October 2018.
