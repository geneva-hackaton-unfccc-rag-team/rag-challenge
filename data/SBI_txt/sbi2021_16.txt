			135.	At the 6th meeting of the SBI, the Deputy Executive Secretary provided a preliminary evaluation of the administrative and budgetary implications of the conclusions adopted at this session, in accordance with rule 15 of the draft rules of procedure being applied. He informed the SBI that several activities resulting from the negotiations at this session called for more secretariat support and required resources over and above the core budget for the biennium 2022–2023.
			136.	Under agenda item 11, “Matters relating to the least developed countries”, supplementary funding in the amount of EUR 48,000 will be required in 2022–2023 for the travel of additional members from the LDCs to LEG meetings.
			137.	Under agenda sub-item 18(a), “Review of the Doha work programme on Article 6 of the Convention”, supplementary funding in the amount of EUR 116,000 will be required in 2022–2023 to (1) promote partnerships with other organizations, the private sector and donors in order to support implementation of the Glasgow work programme on Action for Climate Empowerment; (2) prepare annual summary reports on progress in implementing activities under the Glasgow work programme for consideration by the SBI; (3) support the COP Presidency in convening an in-session event at each COP session; and (4) enhance communication and information-sharing about Action for Climate Empowerment and its six elements through existing UNFCCC web-based resources and communication activities.
			138.	Under agenda item 19, “Arrangements for intergovernmental meetings”, supplementary funding in the amount of EUR 280,000 will be required in 2022–2023 to (1) prepare the biennial report on the implementation of SBI conclusions on ways to engage observer organizations in the intergovernmental process; and (2) explore ways to encourage broad participation of observer organizations, including those from developing countries and youth organizations, using technology to enable virtual engagement.
			139.	The aforementioned activities under agenda items 11, 18(a) and 19 are recurring or long-term activities, which means that they would be funded from the core budget in future bienniums (after 2023) if approved by the appropriate governing body.
			140.	Additional requirements arising from conclusions and decisions adopted under SBI agenda items 15(a), “Capacity-building under the Convention”, 15(b), “Capacity-building under the Kyoto Protocol”, 17, “Gender and climate change”, and 18(a), “Review of the Doha work programme on Article 6 of the Convention”, are expected to be absorbed from existing resources in the Trust Fund for Supplementary Activities.
			141.	The Deputy Executive Secretary noted that the amounts presented were preliminary and based on the information available at that time. He expressed the hope that the secretariat can count on the continued generosity of Parties in providing funding for these activities in a timely and predictable manner. He noted that without such contributions the secretariat will not be in a position to provide the requested support.
