	2.	Conclusions
		10.	The SBI took note of the further progress made at SBI 48.2, aiming to complete its work on the PAWP in a timely manner and to forward the outcomes to the Conference of the Parties (COP) at its twenty-fourth session (December 2018) at the latest.
		11.	The SBI requested the secretariat to update, on the basis of the outcomes of this session (see the annex), the online platform referred to in paragraph 3 of decision 1/CP.23, which provides an overview of the work of the COP and the subsidiary and constituted bodies on the PAWP. The SBI agreed that the progress achieved at this session provides a useful basis for further negotiations by Parties on PAWP matters and their successful completion at COP 24.
		12.	The SBI agreed that the presiding officers of the APA, the SBSTA and the SBI should prepare a joint reflections note addressing progress made to date and identifying ways forward, including textual proposals that would be helpful for advancing Parties’ deliberations. The purpose of doing so would be to address all PAWP matters so as to ensure their balanced and coordinated consideration by the APA, the SBSTA and the SBI, and to facilitate successful completion of the PAWP at COP 24. To that end, the SBI requested its Chair to work closely with the other presiding officers on such a note and to release it by mid-October 2018.
